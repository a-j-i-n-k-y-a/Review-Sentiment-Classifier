You can link an e-mail address that you set as your support address and any e-mail received will automatically generate a support ticket on it. From there, the support team can either reply straight away or assign the ticket to any other member team that would be able to reply to it.Tickets can be marked in the platform as Open, which is the status that they will automatically have when a new message is received; as Pending, when you post a reply to it or acknowledge it; or as Closed when the ticket is resolved.The platform also provides statistics on how your support team is performing so that you can see reports based on the average first reply time, or the satisfaction rating from users.",1

Zoho Desk it's the best application I've ever used,1
Pros:I love its user-friendly interface and its automation. It has very good ticket management. Making and observing reports is much easier when using it.,1
If I am impressed with the non-customized option then I am sure I would be very happy with the customized one too. Only that I need to get it sooner for better handling and data extraction.,1

Overall, it is very important in handling support based tasks that run 24*7.",1
We are already users of ZOHO CRM so Integration is a plus.,1
We are able to manage all the support Tickets from the portal and visible to all the concerned persons,1

Freshdesk support was always there with quick responses and quick solutions to any issue or question I had. In most cases it was always a user issue (me) and not something on their end. I had a great experience with them and their product!,1
Easy migration to a new ticketing system.A fresh updated and easily accessible interface without VPN or any other type remote connectivity software.,1
Overall positive feedback. We would like to see features be able to be added on ala cart.we would also like easier integrations such as billing and inventory software to easier manage items being sold.,1
"My experience in using OTPs is more than 10 years. OTP successfully solves the problems of automating IT services, integrated customer support services. We also successfully use OTPS for the implementation of HR processes.",1
"I have deployed Jira Service Desk at a big online university in Spain. They had already other Atlassian products such as Jira and Confluence.The alternative was Freshdesk, but Jira Service Desk had a way better integration with Jira, the tool they are using for all the software development, issue tracking and project management. It is also very clear in the usage model and configuration.The product has evolved nicely from V2 to V3.",1
Pros:I like that the software is free and has enough features to get a small company by until it is time to upgrade.,1
"Overall, my team is very satisfied and can learn this on first time use.",1
Zendesk allows me to track the type of support requests that come in from our clients and also gives me hard numbers of inquiries to support detailed information we need for progression reports.,1
"Overall, the experience was below what I expected. We were sold the world for this product on how it would transform our customer service and experience. Instead, the product resulted in more problems than what should occur. I should have seen the signs when we signed up and had to debate with multiple departments on getting the search bar to work and tags from day one. The support lacks and the team despite our feedback is reluctant to budge on a refund. Overall we have the left the solution because it saves us time and money by going back to basics. I would only recommend this product to a medium to larger sized business. Not for smaller teams as it is not worth the time when compared to other tools.",0
"Overall, the software is excellent, especially in terms of the customer database and usability. In Zoho CRM, the reporting is also excellent.",0
"Overall, an excellent product! If you want to improve the efficiency of your operations. Zoho is the answer! Furthermore, the cost is extremely fair.",1

I really enjoy their user experience,1
"Zendesk Suite isn't bad. Suitable for those who are into Customer Service, but may not be a strong suit for those who are into technology or highly familiar with features. Zendesk is best said to be beginner-friendly.",1

Pros:It helps us to organise and better understand the current progress.,1
Pros:Get the request to the right audience.It can be widely used in many industries.Receive requests from multiple channels,1

We have had a very good experience with Freshdesk. As our needs evolve we are finding Freshdesk is able to meet our needs every step of the way and we still have not exhausted all the tools at our disposal.,1
Have been using on daily basis so it is a lifeline for our organization so far.,1
"I have had a great experience so far, ticket generation and the mobile app are great.",1
The software solves a real business need. It's a shame Freshdesk does not integrate very well with Freshsales.,1
Pros:I appreciate that when I am looking for a specific topic to review Zendesk suggests other topics that are related to your search topic.To submit a request to our customer service reps is very easy through AIMS Zendesk.

"It's a comprehensive bundle that allows us to answer any queries or concerns our clients may have. Using this program, we are better able to maintain satisfied clientele.",1
It is a good ticketing software and has really boosted my customer support department.,1
We are now supporting multiple large customers using the software and our efforts are now focussed around our own internal improvements as opposed to improving the customer facing experience.,1
We have successfully launched a client's service desk ticketing system utilizing Zoho desk and the client has been quite pleased.,1
Overall iits a great tool than other industry tools,1
Its a pain. Filters are a mess. Notifications are awful.With webhooks I was able to do a workaround: https://www.afterbanks.com/guboard/calendario/?email=david@afterbanks.com,1

"We needed to migrate from a support solution that was bought out by Microsoft.Microsoft CRM Dynamics was too expensive, so we reviewed over a dozen solution providers.The Freshworks team worked with us to ensure we had a successful implementation (3 months - part time).They were also very receptive to our feedback and have incorporated those ideas into Freshdesk.We just got done adding another SSL certificate for our latest product's portal.The support team came through again with flying colors!",1
Customer satisfaction,1
Já uso a muitos anos é robusto e,1
"Overall, my experience has been good. I use it to check on certain issues that are still pending. Even though I'm not part of the team who is handling the issues, I can still easily check on the progress/updates.",1
Pros:The desktop version is just great. the snippet feature is time saving.tagging is very useful.Finally we have one source to look at instead of email.,1
"Overall the Zoho Desk platform has been a good move for us. We switched from using Zendesk and have not looked back since. There are tools in Desk that you can import your Zendesk info to aid in migration to make it almost seamless. As with any other tech platform made for larger scales of users, there are some things that are frustrating because that is not how we want to do it. But the system has enough features to be able to work around those frustrations and continue with the process.",1
Pros:Software muito fácil de utilizar e integra com as melhores ferramentas.,1
"Overall experience with customer service/ support has been excellent, and also with the softwares ease of use.",1
Tracking problems and setting priorities. Allows the ability to pinpoint the more problem issues around the organisation.,1
We used to use a free IT support system. Zendesk has dramatically changed how we approach IT support. The set and forget mentality that is Zendesk. We used to deal with disorganization and random people stopping us in the hallway. This would result in us forgetting to address the issue and add further frustration for our end users. Zendesk is so easy to administer and even easier for our end users to put tickets in.,1
"Useful in managing day to day activities and incoming requests, excellent level of service",1
"As a web-based ticketing system, this is easily accessible from multiple locations and devices. Experienced users of ticketing software will have little trouble navigating, but new users may find the interface a bit less-than-intuitive.",1
"Overall, the Zendesk platform meets and exceeds the needs of our business. It has helped us streamline our customer support processes and improved overall customer experience.",1
"Una grata experiencia hasta ahora, es muy accesible económicamente.",1
"Pros:I love that it includes ALL of our channels of communication. Using an internet fax solution as well, we are able to do that through Zendesk. All of our communications with a client are through Zendesk, and the tickets can all be linked together. This gives us a better picture when reassigned to another agent, or if there is ever a need to escalate, we already know what the situation is.Customization and setup are ridiculously easy, and they have lots of on-demand training videos you can watch. These are paid for, but they are crazily effective and I highly recommend it!",1
"We started using other Zoho software this year, and found ourself feeling overwhelmed with all the channels in which we receive customer requests. We are not a company that offers products that require support. We don't offer the public knowledge base features in Zoho Desk, but this was an attractive option for us to receive our customer emails, and track phone call requests. This has allowed us to ensure all customer requests are routed to the right person to handle their needs, be it dispatch, billing, or general support. Bringing all our channels into one place has really helped with the chaos.",1
"Excellent platform for managing your customers, handling their queries, and giving them a constant satisfied service",1
"The support is great, and the tool never gives errors.It is great.",1
Well. It is straight forward and easy to use. We like the integrations with internal and external software.,1
The Service Desk helps our team track a flood of incoming requests and make sure that none fall through the cracks. We love how it integrates with our our project tracking and documentation tools: Jira and Confluence.The price jump from 3 agents to 4 is substantial. I would really like to see an in-between pricing for a team of about 5 agents.Service Desk solves the problem of managing both internal and external requests so that there is a well defined process in dealing with them. It also tracks our response times so that we know everyone is getting attention instead of the squeaky wheel gets the grease.,1
Pros:Our customer service/community team utilizes Zen desk to address issues raised by our large community and generally track and manage tickets.We particularly appreciate the strong analytics platform behind Zendesk as we are a metrics and data driven organization.,1
"Pros:The integration with Zoho CRM is game-changing. It's so simple to set up and gives our Sales + Customer Service teams complete transparency into what the other is doing.It's really intuitive — of all the Zoho apps, Desk is the best for ease-of-use and straightforward UI. I like it even more than Zendesk.Powerful automation features.Love the customer portal + knowledge base, we use it every day.Nice little features like snippets or copy-pasting knowledge base articles mean that ticket response is a breeze.",1
"Overall, it is a solid option for businesses looking for an all-in-one customer service solution. It may not have all the features that some of the large customer service software have, but it is cost-effective and easy to use. Additionally, it offers a free plan and a free trial, which allows businesses to test it before committing to a paid plan.",1
"Pros:Makes communicating with internal teams and external teams organized, plus automates some workload. They have a great support team as well.",1
Pros:Linked issues to solve customer needs. Easy communication to the customer. Workflows to track the status of Issues. More than fair licensing options and several deployment possibilities.,1
"Pros:Our support team has used Zendesk for the past 4 years and it is a major improvement from our last support system. The monthly statistics are great to see how we are doing as a team, as well as, the knowledge base feature for both in house and customer facing.",1
"Freshdesk allows us to maintain an easy-to-use Knowledgebase to dramatically reduce the number of help questions we get from staff, and by nature of that, dramatically increase response time and customer service quality.",1
Keeps all information on one system and staff understand,1
Pros:Our company uses Freshdesk to notify staff of phonecalls/issues from members. This is great for ensuring response times are kept to a minimum or reminding staff that they still need to follow up on an inssue.,1
"It is incredible to have an obvious interaction while mentioning support, it is simple for you to see the improvement of your ticket and who is or has chipped away at your solicitation. You need to have a distinct inventory; in the event that you don't do that your help demands steps could be too much.",1
Pros:How easy it is to split tasks among other team members when your department may not be the core department.,0
We normally handle 6000 cases a week using Zendesk and Zendesk Chat.,1
"I love using Freshdesk to communicate with home office in China for my job.Also, it is a great way to communicate with fellow teachers around the country/world. We share ideas and contribute to discussion posts to help grow our community for the better.",1
"Pros:Zendesk Suite is an exceptional solution that offers a unified workspace with a contextual interface. This means you can manage and access all your customer interactions across multiple channels like email, chat, phone, social media, and more, from one place. You can view the complete history and profile of each customer, as well as relevant information from other sources such as CRM, e-commerce, or billing systems. With Zendesk Suite, providing personalized and consistent service to your customers has never been easier, irrespective of how they get in touch with you.",1
"Thanks to Zendesk, now everything is optimized and well organized, we can offer more productive and professional services to our customers.",1
"Pros:Zoho Desk offers a wide range of features, including ticket management, multi-channel support, self-service portals, automation, SLA management, and reporting.",0
Pros:The social media integrations just work (and flawlessly too). It has helped my company move from a dodgy process to an awesome customer servicing machine,1
"Overall, Zendesk Chat does as you'd expect. The macros are wonderful.",1
Pros:We are testing the Zoho Desk from aprox. 15 days and we are happy to share that the configuration part is so simple and our IT department is easy to understand the concept of using this. Earlier we are using other support software but this Zoho Desk is very user friendly and easy to install and setup.,1
"My experience so far has been great, and I believe it will be better as time goes by.",1
Great product to stay organized and ensure good communication with the customer.,1
Pros:The user interface is very convenient to use both for support agents as well as customers.The prices are also quite affordable as well.,1
We use Freshdesk to manage all of our incoming client support requests - it's made things much simpler for our clients and our team. It is easier for me to manage overall the productivity of the team and report on the status and volume of tickets we receive.,1
"Pros:Zendesk was very easy to setup and get started with.It was easily integrated into our platform through the REST API.Our customers find it easy to enter in support tickets with enough information and our agents find it extremely easy to work with and search for information.It has plenty of add-ons for linking to popular platforms like JIRA, Salesforce, Slack and so on.",1
Pros:Powerful AI tools to support the scaling of our CX function,1
It's a great organizational tool.,1
muy buena plataforma para llevar la integridad de tu informacion,1
"Pros:Logiciel très simple d’utilisation. Il permet de soutenir la partie service client, service après-vente et conseil client.",1
like this for IT ticket. I have utilized other likewise yet Freshdesk have more highlights then some other item.,1
Pros:Easy Onboarding. Customer support. Multiple features to make customer services agents work in an efficient way.,1
Very happy with Zendesk! Would see myself and the teams using it for the future too :),1
"The company I work for is partnered with a business that utilizes Freshdesk for their help desk, knowledge base, and ticketing system. From my perspective, the system is incredibly simple to use and has a clean, user-friendly interface. We can open tickets from the web app itself or by emailing the provided support address specific to the company that uses it. It's search functionality for open/closed tickets and support documentation is strong and easy to use. We're a small business looking to scale and when we get large enough to necessitate a ticketing system, Freshdesk will likely be the first app we look to.",1
Pros:I like Jira for its simplicity. These last few months that I started using it at my new job I understand that I had suffered a lot previously. It is easy to manage tickets and incidents as well as knowledge sharing with my colleagues.,1
"Practical, able to manage tickets and support customers",1
"Time management, KBs and support!",1
"Zendesk allows you to set up your escalation structure however you'd like. There are groups and tiers, and you can set up triggers to grab incoming tickets and give them to those responsible. You can also mark tickets clearly as open/pending/on hold/solved.With this and the internal note function, we never need to communicate outside of zendesk on the status of a ticket. We can also track these tickets and our overall success rates using these classifications.",1
"This software has been really efficient since not only it allows to give a good attention to the client but also it is possible to do a follow-up to the attention agents to know who stands out the most, who are available to take care of the client and this makes that not wait for any client but all are served in the best way possible and you can solve their problems in the shortest time, there is also no way to have a collapse in the channels as there are different channels of attention that can be chosen to suit each client, that is why I think Zendesk is a tool with great potential and can be used in any type of company regardless of the size of it.",1
"Zendesk is great. I believe that every organization that uses a ticketing support system should have Zendesk as their first option. It is very easy to use, has a lot of reporting tools to extract data and customer satisfaction, and it allows different integrations from other apps to be implemented.",1
As we all know time is money and everyone wanted to utilize there time appropriately to increase productivity. Zoho Desk helps up to keep a track on all customer service tickets and ensures we don't miss out of a single ticket.,1
I can offer to my customer a portal for tickets managene,1
"Pros:We use Zendesk chat since it was called Zopim: it's very simple to implement in our websites and I've recommended it to many customers of us. Simple to customize, too: you can change colors, setup display and be operational in minutes.",1
"Pros:Zendesk allowed us to immensely improve our support ticket workflow. Previously our process made it very difficult to keep accurate records of incidents and generate reports against them. Now we are able to manage our support traffic in-flows, assign them with a few clicks, monitor progress to solution, and generate insights to improve our support performance.",1
"When using it in the free version certain functions are limited, but for a small company with less than 10 members it is perfect.",1

Fresh this year help me straighten up my business and keep everything organized I wouldn't want to have a business now without first disc I've brought my friends to fresh desk I know there's three of my friends that run their business that has bought fresh disc so try.",1
Zendesk helpdesk has streamlined the way that we track our support requests.,1
Pros:too many useful tool and easy to use friendly interface,1
"Pros:I love using Freshdesk. We evaluated 3 top-tier customer support management system products to manage our complex array of products and Freshdesk was the clear winner on functionality and price. While it's true, one of the contenders could have met our needs a tiny bit better. The price tag was 8x higher than Freshdesk.That's not a joke. From the moment I saw Freshdesk, I loved the simplistic design of the site. It reflects how they do all of their development. Features are added gracefully and in ways I don't always expect. For example, we had major problems with multiple agents working on the same ticket.Freshdesk added a very simple indicator that shows icons detailing that someone else is looking at that same ticket. It's very subtle, but very effective. All of their features are focused on high-usability, without cluttering the screen with additional controls. It reminds me of how Apple does UI. It's simple and elegant.",1
After initial hick ups with the system being slow I now really like it and cannot see myself using any other ticketing system.,1
"Pros:My favorite part about this software is the knowledge base.This has helped us immensely on our team.Certain parts of the knowledge base show up based on the company the user is associated with.This allows us to set up public tutorials, internal tutorials for our staff, then another section that just our internal help desk can use.It is also very user-friendly, our students and staff can easily create tickets and we are able to customize the fields for tickets.I don't use a lot of the features with phone and automated ticket assignment, but I can see how this would be useful for a larger organization.I honestly have no complaints and whenever I have a question or issue, support has responded and solved my issue quickly!",1
Overall Zendesk is a good software to use for a growing business.,1
"I came into a support team that already had it set up and some of the users were not advanced in technology so they have made the product almost unchangeable without breaking so many different boards. Given the time and money, I'd say it could be great if I implemented it myself.",1
Work flow,1
"Pros:Overall it was great because the product is so rich in features/functions. Getting help to understand how to make the best use of this product can sometimes be a challenge, It makes your users happy to be able to text, email, live chat, and text on social media.

"My experience has been a test and rehearsal since, as mentioned, sometimes I understood certain things but others became a little difficult to understand and it is not because there is no documentation, there is a lot, but very watered down.but little by little and I have been understanding the things that I need.This has made it easier to serve customers very quickly in their incidents, which in other traditional media would take longer and take time.There is also evidence of the ticket in case the client wants to see the follow-up of her case",1
"Pros:FreshDesk has automation tools - Dispatcher, Supervisor and Observer. With them, I can configure the automatic processing of applications as they become available, according to a specified time interval or for any events. This is definitely more convenient than manually processing applications.",1

Overall my experience with Jira is awesome as I got used to the system itself.,1

"In general, the platform has helped me a lot in managing communication and generating tickets. It would only improve the time of transfer of messages from communication channels to the platform and the breakdown of messages when you have a bot. Outside of that I highly recommend it to have a better control of communication in your community",1
Pros:Service Management is very easy to get going out of the box for small organizations. We stood this up apart from our enterprise's main service management tool because we had special needs for our intake forms and this allowed us to do the customization needed without going through rigorous development through the enterprise level tool.,0

"Pros:Very user friendly, very organized, easy to search, and has a great look to it.Everything is sleek and well organized.",1
"Before JIRA Service Desk we were stacked. No KPIs, so no SLAs; no real time reports, no ability to comply with any customer's customization request.JSD helped us to revert this situation in just a few clicks. We ran the migration tool with our legacy system data and, voilà.... JSD working....We have now:- Accurate KPIs which allow us to comply real SLAs with our customers.- Real time information - what is going on at any time: that means we can also react quickly to avalanche's situations.- Real flexibility to adapt the customer portal to our customers' requests, adding new custom fields or just only making visible the existing ones.- And the most important: we've got happy customers. This is real value !!!As a customer support manager, I also like the Dashboards... and, believe me, their are also very useful for the technical staff...",1

Within FreshDesk I solve technical problems for our clients here at Consult & Design. If there is an issue with a clients website an email will come into Freshdesk and here it will be dealt with as FreshDesk is our Support Central. I really enjoy using FreshDesk and use it daily with ease - great software.,1
Overall it was a very good experience. We were a startup and needed this for our 2 agents customer service department. We handled inbound through emails (tickets) and phone calls. This product was very good for our business.,1
My experience with Zendesk has been good. All our requirements were met. The product is priced on the higher side and there are some cheaper solutions available in the market,1
Can't compete with the free/cheap aspects of this particular software.,1
"Pros:Zendesk makes it really easy to organize all requests no just in-house team but outside customers. Not a great fan of cloud base solutions but everyone is jumping on Virtual Servers and Cloud base solutions is like a force movement like me writing this review when Im just evaluating a solution and alternative to G Suites from Google. Workspace from Facebook calls my attention eventhou is also cloud base but is the closes in Features. Just like the Standalone version of Zendesk that we all learn too user the codes and independency of running the software on the local network overpasses any cloud base solution in my opinion. Automations and Macros are great working locally without the need of High bandwith which we can afford in USA but on other locations in the caribean is a luxury even for big business to have the bandwith we have. OOOOhh And what happens at hurricane season? when we had blackouts we still ran the Zendesk locally. An example of such dependency of cloud based systems is the Automations function doesn't flow in a similar way but are timed instead of instantaneous compare to local run version of the software. Macros allow you to update a ticket's tags, message, and other information with a click of a button. Zendesk has done a great job to make a ticketing system and keeping up the standard with the growing number of completion.",0
"Solving customer issues, quick to use means out response time is short.",1
Cheap effective solution for handling incoming client requests.,1
"Pros:Our intake team would not be able to survive without JIRA Service Desk. We direct all employees to the platform with any technical issue they have, and it keeps all of the requests organized and streamlined. We really like the collaboration functionality since we often have multiple people working on the same ticket, and being able to upload files and screenshots of the user experience makes working through the reqs a million times more efficient.",1
"Pros:The analytics are very insightful, it solves for us support management/knowledge base management/customer success (a CRM software provider with 12k clients) The knowledge base management in 6 different languages is very user friendly and easy to manage.We were able to gradually extend the functionality, first developed ourselves to integrate with our backend. Then integrated Chat management/integrated JIRA/ review management (we are still able to extend with chat bot and forums if we want).",1
"I looked forward to setting up JIRA Service Desk as a welcome challenge to create a helpdesk ticketing system from scratch. They have some presets for you to choose from, but only a couple of them were applicable to the way we do business out of the box. I enjoyed that I was able to create workflows to make automation easy/possible. However, I was constantly running into configuration confusion when trying to piece together the parts that make everything work properly; the admin console was often hard to navigate. Licensing was also an issue for us. We were using the cheapest version of the software because there were only two administrators using the software, and the price spike didn't warrant more licensing. However, I wanted to be able to assign users to specific roles within a ticket so they would be able to receive status emails, but they were unable to watch or approve tickets because the console did not recognize them as properly licensed users. To me, licensed users should not need to include managers who may need to watch or approve certain tickets, but Atlassian's structure is not setup this way.",0
"Pros:This product is well Adapted for this Industry. It is well built, reliable, and can get things done. We. An have multiple escalation routes, track out tickets easily, and keep track of everything in a logical manner.",1
"It was a royal pain integrating with Freshdesk as a developer.I've integrated with numerous (10+) third party APIs and Freshdesk was by far the worst due to their anti-consumer architecture.One feature is all they need to add, but apparently, they don't know how to build a consumer-focused vendor API.Freshdesk, please Google External IDs and save every single one of your customers days of extra work.",0
"Pros:I like that it has all of the features of Jira along with a modern support desk.We can customize workflows, fields, etc all while maintaining a quality customer experience",1
"Overall it was a good experience, they are a big company so the service can be a little bit flaky. My AM was not even aware of me.",1
Fantastic so far; been using it for almost 5 years.,1
"Pros:Flexible, extendable, easy to use, and powerful.We are able to customize and expand the use of JSD very easily.This flexibility allows the tool to fit into our internal best practices.",1
"Pros:Freshdesk in its basic plan is free to use. Yet it offers many things to do and features, that are more than sufficient for small and most medium sized businesses. Paid plans are fairly priced and offer a lot of flexibility. Like the daypass option, which allows to give access to an additional agent for just a single days. This is way cheaper, than upgrading the plan to support another agent, which might not even be needed every day.",1
Pros:El software es muy fácil de usar y las llamadas son de alta calidad.,1
It provides 24/7 customer support thus increasing customer satisfaction.,1
Pros:The ticketing system is user-friendly and the automation features save tons of time.,0
Pros:Is a recommended tool if you are starting to get familiar with this tracking systems. It has a free trial that you can try on with different users and also is very easily to understand.,0
Great support solution for tickets and addressing customer needs,1
"Pros:Our team operates 2 different E-Commerce brands out of Shopify that have gone up in about a year and half.We could not have done it without Freshdesk.To me, it's similar to Shopify in that it is a true example of how building a product based on the user experience, then designing your reporting & data analytic capabilities, can deliver a powerhouse product.Freshdesk is a clean, intuitive experience that multiple Customer Service associates have picked up and been ready to roll with in a day or two.We have fully integrated it with our Shopify site - tickets submitted on our site come through Freshdesk, as does the on-site chat window, ALL social media comments or posts, and our cust service number.As our team member is speaking with or responding to a customer, she has all of the information tied to their order right in front of her, built into the ticket - that's the Shopify integration.We have most recently gotten disciplined about we are using the tags feature, which again operates very similarly to how Shopify does.Our service rep now has a list of all tags that should be connected to tickets and what they mean.This makes it super simple for us to run reports on common customer complaints, centralize PR inquiries, etc.",1
"Overall the Zendesk Chat software has helped boost the communication between our business and our customers. We like that we can supply answers right away to people, although it can be a little time consuming if you receive a lot of chats during off-business hours. The history of visitors is helpful though if you miss and chat and still need to get in contact with the customer. I don't know if there are any better chat apps out there, but if not this is a pretty good solution.",1
We wanted out of box support solutions so we moved from Salesforce to Zendesk so we don't have deployment cost in Zendesk. Everything comes out of box and as an Admin u just to read their Knowledge KB and configurat the system to meet ur business needs. We have achieved 24 x7 chat support services with the help of Zendesk chat which is a excellent software,1
"Pros:Functionality where it can be used for onboarding/offboarding requests, software vetting, as well as Change Requests for our Change Management board",0
"Pros:Zendesk Suite provides an user-friendly interface, you can easily get in contact with the customers/users through support tickets, the system organization is pretty neat as you can establish which member of the support team gets assigned the tickets.",1
"Pros:I love Zendesk! I have used so many different ticketing systems and this is by far the best. It is easy to navigate around, easy to setup things such as rules/triggers/departments and macrosAnd I highly recommend this system",1
"Overall, Freshdesk is a good option for businesses looking for a comprehensive tool to streamline project management. However, it's important to evaluate the cost and customer support against the business needs before making a decision.",1
Very good once you know how to use it.,1
"Pese a tener ciertas limitaciones, la herramienta ofrece una amplia gama de funcionalidades y puede llegar a ser útil para pequeñas y medianas empresas que necesiten gestionar el servicio al cliente.",1
Monitoring Helpdesk Calls,1
Pros:The tickets are forwarded to email automatically.,1
"Pros:The easy customization and personalizing the workflows in JIRA make the product powerful, We have tailormade the workflows for our business processes and case management",1
Learning on ticket management,1
"My overall experience with ServiceNow skews negatively because it's not easy to find what I want, the only somewhat saving grace is the built-in favorites you can save for commonly used areas.",1
Sincèrement j'adore zendesk. Il a trop de bénéfice.,1
"Pros:Multiple ways to integrate with other productsEasily customize and RebrandLots of great features like workflows, SLAs, etc.Unlimited customers",1

We lover FreshDesk and expanding to the other FreshService addons.,1
"All in All, I liked the software, it can be said that one of the best ITSM solutions regarding the request fulfillment and incident management process can be awarded to this product.",1
"Businesses who are searching for an all-encompassing customer care platform might consider Freshdesk as a viable option. Although it provides a wide variety of functions and connectors, some users may find that it is sluggish, and the reporting features are not sophisticated.However, it offers a user-friendly interface and a customizable ticketing system, which are both advantages.",1
"Pros:In Service Now I appreciate a lot of features that helps me to work on my daily tickets with a pleasure! Great reporting abilities, easy to use dashboards keep my work organized which helps me keep my performance on high level to provide best support!",1
Freshdesk is a highly useful help desk or customer complaintmanagement platform. Its social media integration is perfect with support for Facebook pages which helped me have a sync with my daily Facebook complaints.,1
"Pros:You can manage your support tickets as you please.Merge issues, whatever the channel is: email, telephone support.And if you need some more juice, there is their API: integrate it with other systems like odoo or vTiger.Also, it helps you to manage billing hours, SLA, remaining support time for the customer.",1
"Pros:Extremely easy to get up and running, and that goes for the customer too. The ability to just loop a support email address into an email thread to create a ticket is very handy. The interface is easy to use and after using Zendesk less things fell through the cracks",1
Pros:linking our customers to our agents with ease no messing about just a simple portal with quick accurate responses customer complaints go down satisfaction goes up great investment,1
I envision great possibilities for integration with other JIRA services. Using it as a help desk is just the beginning for me.,1
"Pros:The price and the way the tickets are handled.The lack of spam control was a big problem for us with our previous helpdesk software, and Zoho Desk is controlling the spam great!",1
"Teachers generally create tickets for me with problems they have with technology.Administration creates tickets for me to evaluate different education systems, set up systems for teachers, arrange training, or pretty much anything.It's all documented in detail in the ticket, along with pictures, links to articles, whatever I need.",1
In our day to day business we use Freshdesk daily as a good application for responding to the users.,1
"Pros:The ability to manage support for multiple products and brands is what Freshdesk offers unlike any others., and what makes it best on the market. One could start their own outsource/contracted support company by using Freshdesk.",1
10/10,1
"Overall, I had a really great experience with this program and would definitely recommend this program.",1
Pros:Easy and simple! Most of the Servicedesk features are already available,1

The collaborative tools (between internal teams) it's marvelous. The approach given to the SLAs gives a different, practical and effective vision, the management of remote work groups is very good .. the customization and integration is super easy and effective .. the Mobile App is very functional .. I recommend 100%",1
Great software for it's role in the customer experience niche.Solid analytics and chat feature for our nonprofits.,1
Very good! Don't know how we could do our job without it!,1
Very solid product and loving the product development.,1
We have tried several desk solutions but most of them lacked the possibility to intergate into our ZoHo CRM sytem and offered not so much customizable solutions such as reports. We also make use of ZoHo Desk to support our incident reports for our management systems.,1
"Our customer support has improved by using Freshdesk. We have some automation going on and the different methods (channels) by which Freshdesk receives requests, are adequat for us. We frequently use the feature to make private notes on tickets, where we can steer who is notified of the note. This helps us find the right person to be responsible for a ticket. Overall, we don't drop the ball anymore by forgetting to reply to a customer, because the request was more tricky or required more insight, and was thus postponed at first.",1
"As our company grew, switching from Freshdesk to Zendesk was like using a kids toolset and then transitioning to a real workshop!",1
"Pros:Es ist simpel zu nutzen, die Ticketverwaltung läuft damit einwandfrei",0
We enjoy using the tool for all of our support needs,1

"I'm a big fan and I wish we would have started using it to manage client/customer requests sooner. It's one of those tools in your workflow that works for you rather and against you because it's been reliable and ever since it's been configured, I haven't had any issues since. I've recommended it to several other people in my network that have expressed similar difficulties to those I was experiencing prior to leveraging Freshdesk.",1
"Pros:The Dashboard helps my team organize themselves.The team is able to see their tasks, pending work and unassigned work that needs to be taken up.",1
"Ho iniziato ad utilizzare freshdesk circa 10 anni fa. Devo dire che una volta capito il funzionamento è tutto facile, dipende come il team interno all'azienda te lo customizza, e ovviamente dal tipo di abbonamento che si sceglie. Noi siamo rimasti soddisfatti anche del servizio clt ci rispondono subito e con gentilezza.",1
We started using Zendesk around 2012(?) and found it to be a great way to prioritize customer needs and make sure we are properly taking care of our clients.I really feel like it just makes the support experience better and easier for a business owner and can't imagine NOT having Zendesk.The majority of tech companies that we deal with also use Zendesk and as someone sitting on the other side for those interactions - they're easy to deal with as well.,1
Pros:This one is the one we relly on the most and for a good reason. It helps us keep track of the tickets and their status.,1
"Overall, I'm happy because it offers great agent training and usage.",1
"Pros:makes it easy, by providing managers with a library of competencies complete with detailed descriptions of the various levels of proficiency, and specific sample comments that help describe and guide performance. Both give you sample employee review comments that you can use as building blocks for the written feedback you provide your employees in their performance appraisal. You can then easily modify or adjust the sample comments be even more specific.",1

Pros:I like how it is simple and efficient in document creation. Has numerous options when you want to integrate cloud services. The free version offers a lot.,1
"Pros:It's definitely an accessible software - I particularly appreciated that customization was fairly easy even for non technical resources. It didn't require a system admin nor engineer to make changes - non developers can easily understand the layout, ui, etc.",1
"The service of Zendesk is simply the most advanced CS platform I've ever seen. Their platform functionalities and the integration level from the perspective of service adaptation to the business units is simply outstanding from other similar platforms. Furthermore, the experience I had with Zendesk Helpdesk people while I was setting up this for my client-company left me with a big respect for them. People over there are simply the experts of their jobs, thus, providing the valuable support at the highest level possible. I'd say, the only disadvantage with Zendesk and one of the most important aspect is the price. It simply unbearable for the small-sized companies as well as in some cases, for medium companies to afford the increase of the agents and services while the company scales up.",1

Can take some work to get emails to get triggered properly.* Missing some featuresthat we used from SolarWinds. We've found workarounds for most, but it would still be nice to have them native.",1

Pros:Jira Service desk is the help desk add on for Jira. It's great because it seamlessly integrates with Jira. If you're on Jira already it's a natural extension.,1
The tool does what it states well. I would recommend starting small and not getting bedazzled by the different packaged they handle.,1
"Firstly, it has vastly improved our customer service; with Freshdesk, we can centralize the management of all customer requests, which speeds up our responses and helps us solve issues more quickly. On the other side, integrating many communication channels into a single setting allows us to process more requests in less time. It has also impacted internal collaboration thanks to features that facilitate our agents working together to address an issue or fulfill a request. Finally, it has customer service metrics and reporting capabilities.",1
"Pros:The support service on our website is arranged through Zendesk - an inexpensive system that meets the needs of the company. Working with tickets is carried out in three ways - a trigger, a macro and an automator. There is integration with CRM. A large set of features saves our time.",1
More visual way of articulating customer requests and gauging needs,1
"Pros:Can be viewed by anyone, easily connected to Salesforce",1

Less mistakes and streamlining of incoming leads.,1
"Pros:Mail integration and Bugs Integration, Multiple departments, all at once!We are still exploring more features on this. I have been using zendesk earlier but found this to be more intuitive and easy to manage. Integration with other zoho products like CRM and Bugs is the best feature!",1
"Pros:A solution platform is what we are trying to achieve and as a startup, we were looking at a simple help desk solution with the capability to have ticketing and resolution process, end to end online. Devise independent functioning was another preference. I can proudly say that our selection of Freshdesk to address these requirements were right.It is a fine solution made with insights of extensive domain experience and hence this is not just a tool but a working solution for help desk / support.Surprisingly simple to use. Sign up, set the right parameters, attend a few training sessions/self learn and go live and a perfectly working support solution is live.Integration capability with so many useful apps further simplifies the process automation. It is a great solution if you wanted to delight the prospects/customers. I recommend Freshdesk to any forward looking businesses with a clear agenda of automating their support process.",1
"Set up a new account and mistakenly used a special character in my company name. Long story short I ended up with two portals and had to merge them. Getting customer support on the phone is a good and bad experience. Bad that I had to wait up to 45 minutes to get through (in one case I was #1 in the queue for over an hour and never got and answer). The good is that once you do reach a rep they were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I felt likeI was speaking with an actual software developer. From what I have learned so far, the app seems good and the mobile application is very easy to use. I am testing this as a switch away from Salesforce Desk that is fucntional but very expensive for a small company.",1
"Wir nutzen Freshdesk für unseren Service, da wir vorher alles über Outlook beantwortet haben. Da wir täglich mehrere hunderte Mails bekommen und die Kunden nach 24 Stunden schon ungeduldig werden, ist ein Ticket-System, das automatische Nachrichten versendet optimal.",1
"For a company that is supposed to support customer service, this has been a truly terrible customer service experience.",1

"Pros:ServiceNow has a beautiful UI and nice interface which makes it easy to use even for non-IT users. I have been in roles where I was an IT analyst and was working tickets, and I'm now currently a user who submits tickets on behalf of technical issues on my team. From both points of view, this software is great. I love how easy it is to use and how you can see the progression of the ticket being worked. Excellent product!",1
"We use it to communicate with clients on live chat, emails, social media and Zend talk",1
"Pros:Based on JIRA, which we were already using to manage our development and support teams and projects.Easily customizable - we were able to quickly add fields (free form, pick list, date/time, etc.) to provide quick value for our Service Desk.Very easy to configure and modify SLA'sVery easy to enroll and manage usersTurn key Web portal and email integrationEasy to relate SD tickets between Service Desks and to non SD projects such as Software DevelopmentEasy to create processes and workflows to route issues between projects (such as a bug reported in SD that becomes a task for the Development team to repair)Time Sheet capability via Tempo - we use JIRA to track all time against projects, GL accounts, etc.There are a few basic Service Desk functions that are NOT available in JIRA such as easy ways to create varying service levels for classes of users; ability to assign tasks to roles rather than individuals, direct access to data for detailed reporting (we use Cloud version and there are some critical fields that are not queryable via the Issues Search, plus there is no way to connect to the database using any other tools.)ConsSometimes serious issues are not handled in a reasonable time frame.There was an issue with email processing that affected many organizations; it took Atlassian around 4 weeks to repair and it caused a pretty serious impact to us.",1
We wanted a response time to decrease with our business and were able to do so with Zendesk.,1
"Pros:It is a very useful tool for project management and documentation, since it can be linked with different applications, as well as allowing you to implement various work modalities",1
We grew our system from a 5 users system to approximately 75 users on an Enterprise platform. We did that under my watch. It was a superb force-multiplier.,1

We use Zoho desk as a maintenance ticketing system in conjunction with Zoho CRM.The two play VERY nice together and offer some awesome features.Over all this platform has worked the best for us in the budget we have.I also think that if our budget was more.... this would still probably be the best system for us due to the fact we canvirtually do anything we need.,1
A very good entry point with a lot of features and a robust marketplace.,1
"Pros:JIRA is the most useful tool for my remote team. I love that I get a bird's eye view of the items and statuses of what my team is working on. I am able to get a quick summary of the items that will make this month's sprint. It also makes collaboration easier as the system promotes ownership, accountability, and progress.",1
A very practical and useful experience that I feel in my work field is already organized and the interdependence and means of communication between the departments are running smoothly,1
"In general, it is good to manage some tickets and interact with the client",1
Sehr Hilfreich und es ist noch gut zu empfehlen,1
