Pros:We have been using Zoho desk free edition for a specific requirement within our business. We are now looking at expanding this to intergrate with our Customer Care department. The problem I am currently having is i need to determine if the proffesional or enterprise is the best option but have run out of trial days.,1
"Overall, a good experience using Zendesk, especially for my first time in a remote sales position. Easy to procure tickets to reach out to people, although keeping track of them was a bit of a hassle and it was too easy for people to mess with the tickets so you couldn't see your saved progress with them.",1
"Overall, Jira Service Desk is helping us to manage beta testing in a cost efficient way while still having a pleasing user experience.",1
"Very positive. A solid replacement for our ageing Helpdesk system and we are now trialling new uses fort this (project management, Asset management)",1
"Many highlights and various ways of communicating with potential client base. As a web engineer, coordinating it into my site was shockingly simple and smooth. We see a ton of potential for smoothing out our deals cycle decreasing information section errands while having the option to arrive at additional clients consistently, without the requirement for a meddlesome contact structure and call that a ton of the more youthful customers are staying away from in these business sectors.",1

"I've used Zendesk for a while, and one of my favorite features is how adaptable it is.Different teams, each with their own set of contractual agreements, timetables, and forms, can use it.The system is tailorable, which keeps us loyal customers. Some platforms resist updating and adding new features.",1
"I like Freshdesk.There's a lot of features in the software that are helpful. It can sometimes be hard to understand all of them at first, but once you dive into the software, it's very helpful in streamlining the ticketing process.",1
I’d be lost without Zendesk for our customer support.,1
I have used Zendesk at a formal office job for almost two years and it was very stable and very convenient to use as a hub to handle all the online requests including social media at a single place. Most softwares usually require days or weeks of training but Zendesk was very easy to use.,1
"I have used Zoho support for a long time. It was not until recently I noticed that they he mad an app. I immediately noticed it existed via GetApp. I downloaded it and I began using it on th trial. I have to say, I love how I can view all the tickets and get notifications on my phone! It is a good app with a sleek interface. The app is also free which is a plus since most competitors in customer support will charge for mobile applications. There are push notifications which let you reply quickly to an incoming ticket.",1

All answers can be found in the Articles on their website. Thanks to this I always managed to answer my own queries by looking at the Articles.",1
If you use all the features it will totally track everything you have done and what you need to do on all your accounts.,1
great customer support,1
We use a different platform and considered switching but ultimately decided not to because it costs more but has the same amount of features.,0
The support is amazing and the logic behind the problem they are solving works really well; it is stopped me from trying out many tools (along with the integrations) that solve this problem.They get it and I am excited for future products from the Freshdesk team.,1
IT service management experience.,1
"I think that I have a lots of experiences with previous Atlassian products and still I have problem setup this software. Mainly because each of their software have different step how to install. Sometimes is just install (deb/rpm) package, next time you must run their .bin file or you must untar archive and everything do a manually. This is something what affects negatively my opinion to Atlassian products.",0
Pricingis quite comfortable/reasonable,1
"Pros:Zoho is undoubtedly evolving as a market leader in providing suite of business apps on SaaS model. Zoho's interfaces are easy to understand and use, and does not require lots of training for the administrators as well.",1
"Zendesk helps us to solve problems of clients through ticketing and social media while they contact us,",1
Mixed bag,1
"I've been using Freshdesk on and off at various ventures over the past three years. I find that it is a great place to begin adding support for your services if you don't already have support, as it is easy to set up and offers all the minimums you need to get rolling at their free tier. I found that is was great for handling between 0 - 250 requests per day with a few agents, however it got clunkier as we tried to scale this approach toward 500-1000 requests/day. The main issues that we ran into were UI complexity and constantly having to jump around to get things done - whether that was referencing a customer's information in detail or jumping between conversations. It is also important to note that their embeddable support widgets are not the best looking, but their API makes up for it - I strongly recommend you write your own front-end components for this if you intend to operate at scale.Overall, Freshdesk offers a great starting place of you don't have any support service in place and I think it will serve most small to medium companies perfectly.",1
"As an administrator I would say, Zendesk chat is a good platform to assist customers through chat and monitor customer service representatives.",1
Pros:I loved the many features that it offered,1
"I am very happy with the Support I receive when I have a problem, they are always friendly and willing to help. The interest shown is always good to experience. We have not experienced issues with the data in Freshdesk yet and is thus far happy with the Product.",1
"Pros:Ease of use,customization to business needs, integration with Good data for visualization easy exporting for analysis.",1
"First of all, they preach by example because Freshdesk's support is top notch. I found myself inspired every time I deal with them and even though I have (too) many years experience in the support business, I have learned from my interaction with Freshdesk's agents. It is clear to me that support is very important to this vendor and they obviously select and train their agents very well. Integrating the product in our environment was very easy and managing it is simple or as complex as you want it to be. I have been using Freshdesk for over 10 years now and they still surprise me with new features and new learning material (lots of how to videos, training and webinars).",1
Managing sprints and product owner processes,1
Customer service satisfaction is really guaranteed if we are using this because we can identifywhat tickets need more attention,1
"Pros:Its completeness and the user friendly interface in addition to the affordable plans. In addition to that, and most importantly, this software is part of the Zoho Suite, which means it is integrated with modules like Zoho CRM...",1
It has help in turn around response to tickets and helps in identifying unresolved ticket on the spot.,1
Pros:It is my first software used for customer service management/contact. I do not know if there are others out there that are more expensive or cheaper or more reliable to use etc. so it is a tad difficult to say what I like or dislike as comparisons are not available to me. I do like the clean interface.,1
Pros:Zendesk is a great system to track customer reported bugs/issues as well as internally reported bugs/issues,1
Overall experience was very positive. Running a tech company requires a lot of customer support and care and Zendesk helped us achieve this. We loved the real-time chats and notifications. It helped us service our customer base with ease!,1
Pros:I've been using this tool for about 1 month now and I feel this is a great application to track tickets.The pending reminder feature is great and it lets us know when to follow up next,1
Efficient tracking of requests in the form of tickets,1

keep an eye in real time on everything that happens between our clients and my colleagues.,1
"buena, flexible y adaptable a mi organización. amigable para entender y explicar a los agents y clientes",1
"En general, estoy muy satisfecho con Freshdesk. Es una solución de helpdesk muy completa y poderosa que es muy fácil de usar. El precio es también muy razonable. Sin embargo, la personalización puede ser difícil y la atención al cliente puede ser lenta en ocasiones.",1
"Pros:Nice GUI, which makes it fun to work with. Still beeing in the beginning to understand the concepts. We are comming from OTRS. We are just using the Email-Tickets for our support by redirecting our support-email to a special. I like the concept of the knowledge base - you create Article you can reference in your ticket answers. And those article become content for you SEO activities.",1
Overall Atlassian Tools are great for our organization because it allows us to streamline everything. You can utilize confluence with the Jira service desk to integrate existing knowledge to self-serve your agents or customer base. It allows for all the right features with Agile Design and sprints - but I do find that they are missing some features that bring the product into modern times.,1
"Total surprise, did not expect the quality level presented. very good",1
Simple way to track your IT work load.,1
"My experience with Zoho Desk has been one of the best. He offers me a complete communication and interaction service, without too many mysteries. It's nice and easy to use.",1

You can take so much value from Jira is used correctly and if the team is well aware on how to use it. We use it on our daily standups and it helps a lot see what other team members are doing and their progress. You can easily spot who has more buffer and who needs a hand. The history feature is also a big plus to see what was changed in the description of the cards. I see this tool is a perfect fit for big companies.,1
"I am mostly happy about Zendesk and would recommend it if you won't need many specific needs and you just want an affordable, easy product to serve your customers.",1
The benefits are limited and overall it is not such a good software product. Will think about discontinuing its use.,0
"Pros:Speed, ease of use, clear UI-UX, customer priority, task management, tracking, auditing",1
Pros:The work with the tickets.And I like the clarity of the user interface.,1
It helped us grow from being small and unorganized to big organization with a hand on everything!,1

To keep order and notes of my cases and tickets,1
"The biggest benefit is having a reliable software that can handle multiple areas of my business, and have the feel of a company intranet. This helps to keep my employees engaged! :)",1
New to the tool but very excited.,1
"We use Zen Desk for our internal IT ticket management system.We have found that when dividing the desk into different groups in the base package there are some limitations.However, the product as a whole does a good job meeting our needs.",1
Jira has made everything easy and integrates with almost everything.,1
"We are able to deliver reporting to our internal business partners (QA, shipping).Those departments can also now pull their own reporting, although there is a limit to how many users based upon licenses.",1
I am able to track and preserve the cases I need to. It also allows my company to measure employee output in an objective way.,0
"Pros:There are few categories which i prefer above all others are ease of use, the level of customizations that it offers and the detailed reporting it provides.",1
"Pros:I think my favorite feature is the internal comments. It's simple, but really helps to have a side conversation with your peers about an issue before commenting to the customer.",1
Pros:Easy to use handle very intuitive. The users learn fast to use it and it is very comfortable for the agents,1
Before Freshdesk tool we was facing lots of issue to make a consolidate reports. Now we have download and create easily consolidate reports and present to management through visualization tools. Also In daily base we are receive tickets from cross-functional department to Freshdesk single platform this is good for us.,1
Pros:What we liked the most is the capability to create agents and centralize all the social media and other applications like whatsapp communication via Zend Desk. We have one place in which we manage all the communication efficiently.,1
This is a tool that has helped in increasing productivity of my organization as we get to service our multiple clients with the structured ticketing system. Tracking unresolved issues has also been made easy and this built trust between our clients and our organization.,1
Pros:Seamless ticket management and a user-friendly interface make Zoho Desk a must-have for our team.,0
A perfect tool for every size organization or even for freelancers as well. All kind of Support and Training are available. A very good software.,1

Running multi tiered support org with lots of agents and escalation paths.Integration with JIRA.,1
Pros:The product does what its supposed to do in terms of chat and support. It provides a pop up on your website that people can easily find.,0
Jira nous permet de partager une vision globale sur l’ensemble des projets ainsi que d’assurer un suivi complet. Chacun est autonome et peut ainsi se concentrer sur ses tâches.,0
"Using FD as a ticketing system is easy to set up and maintain, however, the limited reportingfunctionalities make it hard for management reporting and the lack of automated reports makes it hard to use a 3rd party reporting tool",1
"It's fine, but it feels incomplete. It's been around for a long time and I feel like they haven't made many improvements.",0
Pros:Process of Trouble Ticketing is very deeply developed and the Ticket can be routed between many Groups/Roles and Queues. Every mail can be parsed and generate a new Ticket.,1

Pros:super easy and efficient way to assign and work emails for an org. i wish all my previous jobs used this!,1
Overall good experience with Freshdesk as it gets the job done and doesn’t require too much work to set up and use.,1
We are using this currently and it seems to be of great use to the team as well as the whole organization,1
Very good. It is easy to use and I can insert any member of my team without much training to start working it immediately.,1
"Pros:I have used Zoho Desk for a number of my clients and highly recommend it for customer services issues. It's easy to put a contact@ourwebsite.com email up, but sorting through and follow up is not as efficient. Zoho Desk is economical (as with many of Zoho's products).",1
Pros:We use this software for internal collaboration on support tickets with our offshore team,1
"For ease of use, it definitely provides cross-team functionality that I found pretty easy to understand and share with junior team members. To implement it from home base when I worked for a REIT out to hundreds of marketing teams on our properties... that was a little more difficult to be honest. There was a learning curve for that.",1
Freshdesk has been implemented as our clients customer service providing solution. It has worked for us since 6 months (onthe free plan). We love the service and highly recommend it!,1
"Freshdesk is most feasible for mid-sized companies. It also performs well with several large companies, however, it is probably not a good choice for large companies where blending with different apps and custom development is necessary. It is also ideal for small businesses and sole proprietorships, as they have very affordable free and paid plans. Even if you only have a 1-person helpdesk, having cases that are customized to a case management system, rather than using email, will make your existence much more convenient.",1
"Overall experience is good. There are issues when it comes to ticket sharing but if I am going to compare this with zendesk, FD far more superior",1
"In all, Zendesk is a great platform to service customers, both internal and external. While I have gripes like the above mentioned missing forwarding, I like that the controls are abundant enough to allow for workarounds to be put in place. This level of control has also lead to some really creative efficiencies produced by my team",1
Pros:All the great conectivity to other softwares and the power of zoho desk.Great work by Zoho Support.,1
"Pros:Freshdesk is very easy to use and the support team appreciated a lot the fact that no extensive training is needed to start to use the tool. In general, is very easy to work with the different channels without struggle.The set up of the platform is also very simple and allows you to personalise not only te views and groups but your advice metrics (SLA)",1
"We're very happy with JIRA Service Desk. The roll out was really smooth. The adoption from the user community was phenomenal. Meanwhile, the requests are coming in and getting resolved faster and more efficiently.",1
There is def. a lot we could use. We are still trying it out and determining what will work best for us.Obviously we are looking for ease of use and collaboration between all our tools.,0
"While we appreciate the overall look and feel of the tool, I think that there should be a lot more options in order to stick to it as sole ticketing system.",0
It was the best decision for our team.,1
"There is not much to complain about. It's well priced, easy to use and has good support channels.",1
Pros:It's easy to navigate and user friendly.,1
"Pros:Tool does its job with facilitating the issue management and reporting process. Ability to upload related documents, comment, and track statuses through resolution.",0

"Having a track of support tickets we are getting and how many of them are solved, how much average time they are taken to get solved, and who had solved them. etc. these metrics are something that we can't get access in traditional email platforms. Zendesk is the platform that helped us in setting up all these things with ease and solved the biggest headache of ours.",1
Pros:We love that it combines with so well with Jira primary software. We use Jira extensively and this integrated very nicely into the rest of our workflow.,0
"Intuitive interface that can greatly aid businesses in providing superior customer service. It supports a plethora of functions, such as ticket tracking, sales funnel management, task tracking, service history, etc. Tracking and responding to tickets is simple. In addition, it has numerous tools for reporting and analysis.",1
This product is a solid choice for your help desk/ticketing system needs.It is not the best on the market but it meets the majority of our company's needs especially if the price is reasonable.,1
"Pros:The depth in this software is abysmal, and as far as organization is concerned, there is no comparable match.",1
I've used Zendesk for several years and was key in its implementation into my department's ticketing process. I see no need to explore other options as Zendesk does everything I need and more.,1
"We have been able to be more responsive to our customers while maintaining high data integrity across our whole business.The team is able to 'chat' in real time with each other about an individual ticket without confusion and the ability for us all to be 'in' the ticket at the same time to see what is going on.The transparency of our interaction with our customers also mean we can address team training needs and discover any shortfalls of our customer service quickly, confidently and positively.",1
"This is an useful application that do not require too much configuration to start working with.You do not to have any support email address in your mail server, Zoho desk allows you to create multiple support email accounts to support your customers or endusers.",1

"Pros:The ease of use and anybody can use the tool for Ticketing, project management, issue tracking, dashboards etc...",1
"Pros:Very easy to configure and use. It took less than a day training for our agents to become comfortable with the tool. It allows quite a bit of customization and the client facing portal is easy to set up, configure and best of all, the whole thing integrates with our existing setup of Jira/confluence",1
Our customer care center and IT use this tool on a daily basis and is rather satisfied.,1
Will be able to reduce manual efforts to increase efficiency.,1
Pros:Simplicity of the use of the tools and efficiency of the rules of automation.,1
Control for customer service tasks,1
"Pros:Just Like the original Jira for development, this one is very good in ticket management.",1
It looks good but perhaps not in my personal taste to use.,0
"Pros:Its SLA reminding time is best, and analysis with graphical tools(pie charts...) is attractive.",1
"The support for the free edition is great! They helped me get back in, after months of not using it.",1
"It is a project management tool designed for teams, it very easy to use. It's also very affordable and a good software to start with",1

"Pros:When it comes to team planning, I quite enjoy the degree of control you can have the phases and hierarchies that may be developed inside the same project or job. I believe that is highly valuable and required for tasks that demand a high degree of detail.",1
Globalement le suivi de ticket est de bonne qualité mais on perd facilement du temps à chercher les informations dans un système globalement contrintuitif.Les notifications sont difficilement utilisables du fait qu'un simple clic sur la cloche retire le compteur de notification. De plus l'empilage de notification par ticket n'est pas lisible.,1
"Migration from our previous system was fairly ease, within a day you can have the new platform up and running. Support was very helpful.",1
Pros:The interface il very friendly and it's clear,1
We started using Freshdesk in 2020 when we needed a tech based solution to fielding a number of enquiries relating to COVID in the workplace.Freshdesk was easy to set-up and we had a system in place in a matter of days with users assigned to different levels of permissions.It meant that we were able to respond quickly and effectively to thousands of enquiries that otherwise would have been chaos on a shared outlook inbox.,1
"Zendesk has been helpful for us to help collect our emails, form captures and calls. Sort them within a ticketing system, and prioritize the tickets as needed. And send them to the person who will reply. Not having someone who has to answer the phone, and then pass that message to the appropriate person is a big help for us.",1
"Pros:Very easy to setup. Available on all platforms incl apps and widgets. Easy to assign tickets, perfect SLA integration.",1
"Pros:Between plugins, custom components and customization you can make the system do virtually anything you like",1
Freshdesk has been a very okay tool to use. It gets the job done but no more than that.,0
Its provided me with a proper format to which tickets can be logged. A new look at what is needed in a ticketing system and how much it can benefit a company.,1
Pros:Its user-friendly interface makes it simple to operate. It can be integrated with social media networks. Users can utilise the software's capabilities with ease. Customer service and company management have an impact on a business.,1
Overall is good that provides accurate basis of performancd and SLA,1
good for small to medium size companies to manage customer support or customer success teams.,1

Pros:Il est facile à utiliser et ne présente aucune complication. Il fournit le service d'intégration de toutes les plateformes de médias sociaux en un seul endroit pour répondre aux demandes des clients. Il facilite une interaction et une communication accrues avec le public. La meilleure caractéristique de celui-ci est qu'il fournit de nombreux services gratuits.,1

"It was an amazing app as it was my first ITSM app, and it was more easier to use, understand and flow with",1
customer support very helpful with requests and will show you exactly where in Zendesk you need to look to implement add ons and to fulfil reports. Excellent forums to find answers which are answered by other end users and official Zendesk customer support.,1
Very happy with it and would recommend to others as well.,1
Pros:We are a small business and getting things off the ground could have been a headache. Not with Zoho Desk! Wonderful support team with quick response times.Features that you can customize to best fit your company.Personalized desktops for each agent.,1
I was looking for a help desk application that would be easy to use and also integrate with my existing systems. I had used Freshdesk before and was pleased with the ease of use and the availability of their customer support.

"I use Zendesk as an in-house IT helpdesk. Instead of having employees line up at my door needing help, they know there's a resource (Zendesk) they can use to find answers that commonly come up during their work day.

"For the past five years, I've been using Jira, and during that time I've noticed a big improvement just about every time. It has been easy for us to keep track of the work that other teams have completed by logging it and adding service level agreements. You can use it to delegate tasks within your team, track progress on common goals, and share updates with your colleagues in real time or behind closed doors. Because of this, it is an incredible instrument.",1
Pros:- Tickets können den zuständigen Kollegen zugewiesen werden- es kann im Ticket mit dem Team als auch mit dem Kunden kommuniziert werden,1

I don't have to pay for multiple apps because this one provides a them,1
"Overall, the system is quite good, but there is definitely room for improvement. It's generally easy to use for the basic actions and the rules that can be set make this a powerful tool.It does begin to get a little complicated when you have several departments using Freshdesk together (for example, adding another department using Freshdesk into a ticket doesn't create a ticket for that department - instead, the ticket has to be flipped, or have to go through parent-child ticketing, which can be confusing for those that are not tech savvy).",1
"Pros:you dont need to be professionalto use it, just need a little bit of time to get use to it. I highly recommend",1
We've been using freshdesk for almost 1 year and setup is seamless and it helped us to reduce the issues happening in our production from the day one. Lots of freshdesk tools like Freshdesk Component helped in engaging with the users creating issues right from our software.,1

"Zendesk allowed me to follow the evolution of my business, and to learn how to quickly manage my requests, tickets...",1

"Overall, this is a solid product with good customer service.Deploying it was fairly complicated, but once it integrated with our existing workflows, it has been great to use.We have not experienced any work-stopping outages.",1
"Pros:Since we use JIRA Software, it was just a matter of time until we decided to implement JIRA Service Desk. So far it's worked fairly well and gives us a central location to manage our helpdesk requests from our employees. Being a JIRA product, you know it's powerful, but you also know that it takes a bit of work to get it up and running. You also know it's not going to look too sexy ;) It does it's job and gives us a good place to manage our tickets and gives our users the option to leave feedback, which helps us do our job even better.",1
"We switched to Zendesk Suite a few months ago, which has been a good decision as the workflow is now more comprehensive and simplified. It's a flexible, powerful and very secure CRM. We can organize and prioritize effectively.",1
"Freshdesk helps us keep track of issues, complaints, questions, even requests for quotes. Our agents can refer to old tickets where similar issues had been reported to see how they were resolved. We have posted white papers for access by our customers for self-help, which I think is a great feature. We have also done customizations for specific customers/projects to help organize customer support.",1
"All in all, it's been working great for us so far and it's been our 2nd year with Zendesk. I recommend it to every businesses.",1
Pros:Love this software! Used it to run a small Help-Desk allowing just 2 IT staffers to keep track of all the companies in-house and remote employees.,1
It helps us to address the needs of our users; we receive thousands of tickets a day in queries and Zendesk makes that process simpler.,1
"Pros:I liked the software for it's functionality. It did do what we needed, it just wasn't really that easy to use.It's semi-extensive with it's ability to archive tickets, and the fields are laid out in a way that makes it understandable, but not easy.",0
Pros:I loved the ease of use and the flexibility of the software in general. I loved the ease of use and the flexibility of the software in general.,1

"Overall Zendesk is easy to use, interface and options are quite straight forward, response is quicker and easy to manage the logs/requests/tickets and users",1
Pros:For the most part this has every module that I could ever possibly want. Instead of having to try to connect out to a large # of different apps I can stay within the Zoho sphere and know that each application will communicate with the other.,1
Freshdesk has helped us to resolve customers escalations efficiently. It proactively informs us if the ticket is overdue or pending for too long. Action required on ticket helps us in maintaining our SLA's.,1
Pros:I like the ease of use. I like that Zoho has an app. I like the accessibility of the softwareI like the customer portal. The integration with social media is also cool.,1
"Pros:Managed queues and interactive reports - this is what our company needs in order to make it as easy as possible for employees to work and systematize customer requests. Now we do not need to sort all the orders, in manual mode, set priorities, etc.",1

"Overall, I can say Zendesk is a good Professional and intuitive platform that makes online Customer service experience easier and more seamless from the interface to the features and functions.",1
Pros:Our whole org can go to one piece of software to request access to various applications. Zendesk also stores the approval chain so it is easy to produce reports for Auditors.,1

Our overall experience has been great. We have been using zendesk for years and I don't see that changing any time soon.,1
"Pros:Zendesk has been a game changer for my company. Timely customer support is crucial to our success and having everything in one place makes sure nothing gets lost and we give consistent responses. One feature I love is the internal notes that can be shared within the company, but not to our customers. Creating customized marcos for quicker response times has been awesome as well!",1

"Pros:It gave us a place to create articles, store articles and group articles to share externally to users as a good knowledgebase",0
Worse I have ever had with any software vendor.,0
Streamlined customer service that links my sales team with my service team. Keeps communications with customers clear across departments.,1
"Our company has been using Zendesk for 5-7 years. I was not personally around when we onboarded it, but I have worked with it for over 3 years now. We have terrible trouble any time we did need support, for a system problem or a question we couldn't answer ourselves via their expansive maze of KnowledgeBase. The support reps at Zendesk have been accusatory, excuse-ridden, and most of all don't even read the tickets you submit to understand the problem (Zendesk support actually became an office joke. That's about the time we decided we had to look for another tool). When we met with our Account Rep to try to get some of the issues worked out, we were told basically that we weren't even supposed to have gotten the level of support we had received, and proceeded to explain how SaaS works (we're a software company, mind you). I think Zendesk simply got too big too fast, and somewhere along the way decided that the businesses using their product aren't important anymore. They lost this long-term customer.",1
"Not bad, but I would recommend Freshdesk over Zendesk because they offer many features in comparison with Zendesk pricing.",1
"Pros:Zoho Desk is Ease to use,Customer Service.",1
"This product is well-made, and it does an EXCELLENT job keeping leaves out of the gutter. Unfortunately, while it also blocks pine needles, the needles on our New England pine trees are fine enough that they manage to get stuck upright in the mesh, and after a while enough of them accumulate so they have to be removed by hand. What's particularly bad is the needles can't be brushed off, but have to be pulled out of the mesh. While this reduces the need to climb an extension ladder to once a year, it doesn't eliminate the need, so in our application the product is OK. Zoom in on the attached picture to see a plucked section and a section bristling with pine needles.",1
Pros:I like the ease of use with Zendesk Suite.I've tried many other options and the layout for Zendesk Suite fits the best and is very easy to work with.,1

Zoho Desk is customizable to your liking, this means it works for you, and you are certain of desirable results. The software is fairly priced, saves money. Customer careis a 10/10, very responsive and informative. It intergrates well with other Zoho products I use and this simplifies my work.

"Pros:During the selection process and found with wings advantages that it is easy to Configure, easy to access and that has an APP for agents very useful",1
"Pros:I love the ease of use. You can organise views, set automated triggers, create macros for a saved reply and handle emails efficiently.

We use tags to organise types of emails and assign certain questions to each other. It's so easy to prioritise awesome!",1

Ticket tracking and escalation matrix enables company to track and manages customer complaints on time.,1
I have enjoyed using Zendesk and its much better than google email I used to use daily for communication.,1

The other stunning area of data analyse and visualization. Tremendous insights can assure you can measure anything related to your customers' care what you would like to.",1
We have used this software for about 2 years and we saw a 50% increase in usage over our previous solution.We have found this easy to use on the agent side and users are likely to use this on the employee side.,1

"Pros:I've implemented Freshdesk as a ticketing system for one of my programming teams. Our team managed eight websites across a university. To handle the vast amount of maintenance and update requests, I sought after a ticketing system that was lean enough that it wouldn't bog down our website and was intuitive enough on the front end for our users to easily submit tickets. After searching for a while, I found Freshdesk, which was by far the best option with the best price. It's automated response system was one of my favorite features.
