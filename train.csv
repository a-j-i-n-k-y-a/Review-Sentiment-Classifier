"Pros:It has alot of features to offer. Telephony integration is one good option as I can. Also the Chat, email and many other features.",1

Pros:I liked all integration the features to capture leads are quite confuse.,1
"I started using this service over a year ago. I stumbled upon it while trying to find an affordable option for a client with a small budget, and was so impressed that I adopted it myself. It's now my go-to recommendation for people who want an integrated service that connects their customer service ticketing system, CRM, live chat support and more. Back in the day, a service like this would've cost tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars, and wouldn't have been half as easy to use, setup, or train people on. You really can't go wrong with this service, especially on the free tier.",1
overall im very satisfied with freshdesk,1
"Pros:from what i've seen/heard it's a more affordable option but with that, and the fact that FD is relatively new to the game, there are better options out there. but FD checks most of the boxes. the reporting and analytics leaves a lot to be desired and isn't very reliable. but if you're looking for a standard ticketing system that allows you to reach out to customers and prioritize work, FD will suit your needs. not a lot of bells and whistles but there are customization options and FreshWorks has been quite accommodating.",0
"Pros:Zendesk has a lot of functionality behind it - automated email responses, integrated knowledgebase solution, chat options.. if you need something to run your help desk, most likely Zendesk has the ability to take care of it.",1
being able to monitor the incoming requests and have a repository for them that isn't stuck in someone's email box is invaluable. I'm still learning the product but see a lot of potential.,1
Overall I am well pleased with Freshdesk. It does everything I need and a whole lot more. If you're in the market for a help desk solution you would be doing yourself and your organization a disservice by not at least giving them consideration.,1
"It did a good job replacing the mode of interaction from social channels, chats, e-mails, and phone calls in one platform. The experience in raising support request by customers is a breeze. Customers also has the option to raise tickets via their native language. The platform has support for 9 languages. It's able to simplify tasks of the help them since they can enhance their ability to track every request and address them by means of priority arrangement.",1
Pros:I have been really impressed with the customisation options available and the simple set up procedure,1

Cost effective Ticketing Software .,1
Pros:The integration with JIRA and Confluence has allowed us to easily integrate our instances and train users.,1
Pros:Overall Freshdesk has nailed the UI/UX design and basics of a support system.Most controls are intuitive and the setup is a breeze.I like that contacts are automatically created with each email sent to the mail listener.The API was easy to use (for extracting ticket detail to local reports).The SLA configuration is simple.The flexibility in email notifications and format for the various help desk communication scenarios is very well done. The software does a good job tracking threads and appending to work orders (without the annoying tag in the email subject line).I first used the software in 2016; they were missing parent/child tickets at that time; they've added it.,1
"Pros:1) Gives the user (customer support guy) a complete outlook of and information about a support ticket created.2) Can also track the ticket details as in, who it was assigned to, assigned date, assignee, where did the ticket origin from.3) Support people are awesome too, have had no issues which they couldn't fix till date. But also didn't have many issues.4) The chatting system is incredible. The huge bubble of active users, the details of the users which are chatting with you in realtime, multiple ways to reach them back if you cannot take the chat currently is pretty good too.5) We haven't even started working on its API yet, from the looks of it, it seems really good and interesting.",1
Its nice to have,1

I really came to Zendesk for its analytics and its ability to expand with tons of app integrations.The analytics really allow me to dive into valuable buisness metrics such as time to first response total time spent per client per month - resolutions times - tagging I could go on and on.",1
"Pros:For both internal and external users, we are required to use 2 different remote connect tools to support remotely. It costs software itself and license, however ZOHO Desk is equipped with this remote connect tool by default.",1
"Pros:Easy to manage and assign different people to tasksGreat features: batch updates, dashboards and follow issuesThis tool allows to create and manage agile projectEasy to configure and use",1
ZenDesk makes my life easier when I am learning new products. It is also makes the lives easier of my clients.,1

don't have any bad problems with this product. Will be much better to have an easy way of learning. I will not tell that everything was simple and smooth. A lot of useful tools to use. We don't have the big bad issue with this software.,1
"Overall positive. I liked being an admin greatly as well as I like being a user submitting my concerns to different companies and brands. Seeing them use Zendesk makes me feel good knowing they are using a trustworthy product. I also know if they don't respond easily it must be on them as a company, as everything is tracked, such as time and date, so it is easy to set TTR metrics using this product.",1
This tool is great for support organizations.IT saves us lots of time being able to sort issues out by priority.,1

Pros:- very easy to set up and fast time to benefits. We use JIRA for issue tracking so it's a perfect way of keeping track of the correlation between issue logging and support delivery,0
"Pros:I struggle to find good things to say. It works and rarely has performance problems. If you need very basic support ticketing and are just starting out, you could use it and be successful. We did. But the functionality and support for those organizations between startup and large corporation is nil. If we were a very large organization, I could see it being a valuable product.",0
"I think Freshdesk is great if you're looking for a low-cost platform for customer service, it solved our issue with redirecting clients to a specific rep for better support. But, when it comes to integrations, I think they have a lot to improve on.",1
Getting exact information for every one of the tickets raised by clients and assisting us with doing course cause investigation for the equivalent so we can help the client appropriately.

"very easy to use, way better than trying to handle this with gmail.",1

While there are some areas where improvements could be made in order to provide more comprehensive capabilities, the cost of subscription may not make it feasible for smaller businesses.",1
Pros:Zendesk Just Works. it has so many customization options to let it do Exactly what yo need it to do!,1
The benefits of using Zendesk include receiving discounts once a subscription is selected and billed annually. Zendesk is available with integrative API's and other software applications.

"Communication has improved, less user inquiries, the available information is easily accessible and the overall time gain to focus on other matters is a great improvement.",1
My team enjoys this tool a lot and we surely feel this is the most suited tool for the workflow we have. Highly recommend for helpdesk in IT,1

All of that and a nice price tag earn it an Editors' Choice award in our helpdesk category, along with HappyFox and Vivantio Pro.",1
Don't waste your time and purchase it if you are considering.,1
Pros:Zoho desk was good for live chat options and ticket support for those who need both in one place.,1

The FD support team is incredibly responsive and good at providing alternative solutions if the product doesn't currently support what is being asked.,1
Zoho Desk est excellent en soi et encore meilleur lorsqu'il est synchronisé avec Zoho CRM.,1
Pros:Super easy to set up and use!Great features for the price.Love that we are only charged per agent.,1
I would highly recommend Freshdesk if you're looking for a scaleable support solution at a reasonable price.,1
"I would like the application to have more search filters, because when handling many customers, finding one in particular, can be time consuming. Integrating all the programs we needed was a slow process and the technical team did not provide the expected help, so we had to hire an external service to solve the problem.",1
"Overall we are very happy with Jira Service Desk; it has allowed us to provide a higher level of support to users than our previous service desk, and non-profit pricing was very beneficial for us.

"Freshdesk is an easy winner in the help desk software category.It is obvious that the guys behind it are serious about making it a great product first, and making money from it later.It is not complex and cumbersome as other products in the category, and on the other hand, it feels very mature and thought through.It is also quite clear that the design and development team work great together, otherwise they couldn't have reached such an astounding level of user experience.For the avoidance of doubt, I would say I am not affiliated with Freshdesk in any way - although I wish I was...Highly recommended.",1

You can tell by the evolution of the UI over the years we've been using this product that they do continuous development and are working actively to maintain their system in a market place that changes all the time. They actively reach out to their customers and ask for feedback and suggestions as well. This product feels like a big product like desk of the larger ticket systems but it also feels small because they are east to reach out to and talk to you like real people.,1

Pros:It is an awesome product and easy to train people to work on,0

"Freshdesk is a robust helpdesk platform, which offers all the key helpdesk features. We have a partner who uses Freshdesk. We asked them for their feedback. They told us that they were happy with the solution and it matched their requirements, even with the Free edition. In 2015, we were looking for a helpdesk platform, because our internal solution was outdated and our budget was tight. We look at the solutions available on the market. After a very quick try we were convinced about Freshdesk: it was adopted! The Free edition (Sprout) offered us everything we needed and it was so user friendly!Freshdesk helps us to save time and money as it automates the support ticket management process: customized support rules, automatic email notification, tickets queue management That's perfect for us and for our customers who use it for submitting support ticket.",1

In the future, I look forward to continuing my new designs in tickets and using more of its features to do so. Another thing that I enjoyed about Freshdesk is the organization tools that they have which makes it super easy to access things. I feel the whole time I'm using Freshdesk I know where everything is and never fear losing anything or not being able to find the things I need.",1
My overall experience with Zendesk is positive. Charging on a per agent per month basis is pretty good as our workforce fluctuates.,1
Zendesk offers a lot of valuable features for management of multi-level contact tickets. The system is very easy to explain and use. Very little training is needed to use this product effectively.,1
In het algemeen is Zendesk het beste platform voor tickets en alle soorten van contact.,1
all tickets,1
"Pros:Zen desk is a convenient tool for us to use to just our analytics company. it allows customers to log a ticket through the portal and provides the ability for us to assign tickets to the appropriate agent to be dealt with in a timely manner. Follow up through the application makes it super easy to use, and allows the tracking of incident to be done with ease. It has made issue tracking much easier and i dont think we would be where we are without this tool",1
"Overall, I found the Zoho Desk user interface to be great. It's easy to navigate and create tickets, which saved me a lot of time and effort. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good ticketing system.",1
Jira has been a lifesaver. I know that any tickets that I submit will not be accidentally overlooked and I can check-in at anytime to see where we are in the process.

"Always fast, pleasant and polite. Nothing but professional, quite happy to use their service.",1

Since we receive so many tickets, the best features Zendesk has to counter this are Triggers, Automations and Macros.",1
"Overall, I can definitely recommend it for people are in a project and they want to be more agile and flexible in their work life.",1
Go value for money and an easy to use setup for our customer service department.,1
"Used to manage software development and other processes in house, the solution is versatile and easy to bring into your Agile environment.Once you get over the initial, unavoidable arguments over issue types, workflows, etc. the day-to-day use is absolutely painless.Basic reporting is easy and it's easy to monitor your Service Desk SLAs.Fantastic solution that ties nicely into its core platform.",1

Pros:We use freshdesk to receive and send emails to clients. I like having the ability of being able to assign an email (ticket) to a group and being able to assign an individual to know who is working on which email so that multiple agents are not working on the same ticket. It also allows to enter private internal notes if there is something specific that everyone needs to be aware of for that client.,1
We use this as our Primary Ticketing Tool.,1
Pros:Great search engine for any text in the ticket. Great for keeping multiple people updated of status updates.,1
Pros:--Great roadmap facilitation--Automatically routes tickets where they need to go,1

"I am extremely happy with Freshdesk. We came from an archaic helpdesk system and decided to just pull the trigger on the new system. Go live went pretty smoothly, and we have an entire team ready to work quickly.",1
Pros:The user interface is easy to use and supported on multiple platforms. You can insert ticket content based on your customers preferred language so that our agents don't have to use Google translate to reply.,1
"The worst Customer Support!Their product appears to provide so much, but it's so convoluted that it's nearly impossible for new customers to set up without assistance from the firm. However, whenever we met with someone who managed our account, we expressed our worries about not knowing how to perform certain things. What would be the reactions? I'll email you Zendesk support articles. Okay, I've been Googling it and plainly it hasn't helped, which is why I'm requesting assistance from a Zendesk representative. We were advised that if we stated that we needed additional assistance, we would have to pay a large sum of money to have a specialized person assist us. We're already paying so much to utilize your platform, which has so many technical issues; at the very least, provide some sort of help.Needless to say, we left after 2 years of struggling to use their platform. Thanks for never helping.",0
"Pros:All our helpdesk tickets come into FD and we run our consulting business with those tickets.The email integration is great.The automation is good.The ability to configure the product for our specific needs is excellent.All in all, it's been a good investment for us because it gives us the ability to serve thousands of customer requests annually.",1
"This has worked pretty well for both support and our help center. There are shortcomings when it comes to communication through the widget, and they got rid of the proactive outreach tool, and these may lead us to choose another solution down the road.",1
Easy customer handling,1
"Pros:It is easy to manage.Integration with Azure AD.Multi factor authentication.Support ticket management, inventory management, change management etc.",1
"If you are looking for software to establish a fully interactive video session with a remote expert which enables the customer to join with a single click, then Zoho Desk is the right software for you. Zoho Desk will help you to solve the real-time problems of your customers.",1

Overall I wasn't happy with Zoho Desk. I would look elsewhere in the future.,1
"Pros:The clean, easy-to-use interface.I have been using the web-based interface and the IOS app. Both are really easy to use and look very good and professional.",1
"Use Cases and Arrangement ExtensionWe have utilized monday.com as an extra CRM for our Client Onboarding and Backing groups. It has helped our colleagues to facilitate with one another on the Client onboarding undertakings, arrangements, and leads. All colleagues can add to every pipeline by sharing updates, applicable archives, and extra records connected with each undertaking and arrangement. It likewise gives admittance to the group leads and supervisors who can screen each task and colleague, giving better straightforwardness to the whole association.",1
Great program and it really helped us grow our business,1
"Pros:FreshDesk does a good job of simplifying the process of getting up and running with a ticketing system for whatever your business or needs are. There are a variety of subscription levels that you can choose from which makes it somewhat nice in terms of what features you need vs which ones you don't need and would rather not pay for. The initial setup is a bit to get through to make sure that you have everything customized the way you want it, but for the most part, once it's up and running it's pretty close to a set it and forget it environment.",1
Pros:The User interface is very user-friendly and organized.,1

Pros:Jira offers great ticketing tracking offering users great support,1
"Pros:I use Zendesk talk on a daily basis from past 4 years. ZD talk is being used by the company which I am working for and all our other sister concerns as well. ZD Talk has been separated by Brands in the system and we are managing the companies. Calls come in and go out from the Software and it is very rare that we face an issue and mostly it is fixed with a little bit of tweaking in the settings or providing privileges. Our whole software support team and professional services use the product to interact through it and get all personnel updated. I have myself asked many of the IT industry users to opt ZD Talk as it can be used flawlessly with less internet speed as well and it does take much of the internet usage. Overall, I have been very satisfied with the product. The most prominent Pros are I can call and transfer calls as well. Use of call recordings and merging of calls from one to another.",1

The communication back to customers is increased and with ticket management features ensuring that the team are working in the right way to meet SLA targets and customer expectations.",1
It has been a great 2 years and we are exited for whats to come!,1
Overall great product helps us complete client assignments really fast and in a quick manner,1

"Its best, but need extra improvement from UI Side",1
"To keep tabs on the many ways in which people have reached out to us with questions about our bespoke products—email, phone, and even in-person—we have implemented a ticketing system in Zoho Desk. We have a long way to go until we fully integrate the system, but so far, what we've seen, we like what we see.",1

We have been able to cut down our support time and not lose track of customer queries. Being able to templatise common support queries and make it accessible across the team is quite indispensible.,1
"We no longer use inboxes to track issues, which results in better tracking and results for clients.Also, we can use past tickets and issues to develop a knowledge, both internal, for specific clients, and internally.We have looked at a lot of tracking software, and FreshDesk is the best!",1
Without Zendesk I have no idea how I would be able to chat with up to 6 customers at once. Its recommendation system and customer history makes it so easier to solve the customer's problems in the most efficient way possible.,1
"It has been great. It was really easy to integrate with our main website, support tickets have come with no troubles. Price is very reasonable and the support given by the company​ has been outstanding.",1

"For a company that makes technical support software, their own technical support is terrible.Zendesk finally responded to my support request to them on Saturday, making it eight calendar days since I submitted it.The agent cited high ticket volume. That's not a valid excuse. We certainly couldn't get away with that. Nor WOULD we.Hey, sorry your money's messed up. We've been busy.The product itself is great, it integrates with our CRM and other systems well. But good luck getting timely help.",1
The software allows us to manage the job flow and keep multiple team members visibility to the job's progress.,1

"Pros:That it is so versatile and customizable, and solves so many problems for our business. It helps us have a clear view of all the tasks going on with our team.",1

Jira Service Desk provides us with this feature without the need to become an agent user. The person must be one of the users of Jira Service Desk, Jira Software, or Jira Core.",1
Pros:Easy to write and organise the documents. Also manual approvals before publish is good.,1
"We tried both JIRA Service Desk Cloud and Server but chose server so we could maintain our own data. Both products allow us the ability to track support tickets and internal projects across several departments. JIRA's basic features are good, but some of our features required we purchase add-ons. For example, we needed the ability to export reports in formats that the basic reports did not allow, needed to display specific reporter information on each issue, and the ability to CC, BCC, and set importance on an email notification. This was all possible with add-ons.",1
Pros:It is very easy to use and because it integrates with all the other zoho products it makes it super simple to get a full picture of what the client is doing. It has a ton of features built in where in other platforms you would have to pay more for.,1

"I opened a ticket with Freshdesk months ago where a feature was not available in the Mint desktop, not a big issue really but I thought they should know.Support had said they were aware of it and were working on a fix.I didn't expect any reply further and just thought it would be fixed, however, they emailed me later to let me know it had been fixed.",1
"Pros:We use Zendesk daily in our technical support. Brand options, dividing agents into groups, internal notes or connecting other agents to each other are useful.",1
Integration and flexibility,1
"Pros:This product is really outstanding, we conducted a review of multiple service management tools and this came out on top.This gives us much more than call logging, there is the ability to set up full SLA criteria based on details logged by the users. When customers log calls depending on the information they provide means that the case they log can be sent to a specific queue for a specific team.Ability to see full detail about customer logging call: asset information, contact information and previous calls.There is a self help option to the product too which can assist with users basic enquiries.",1
Freshdesk helped us with a lot of issues we had with in the past with our other system. We had duplicated tickets all the time and also the reporting engine is very impressive,1
Pros:Easy to use basic ticketing system. Good integration with other Zoho apps. Because we are a small shop it helps when our Zoho CRM users (sales & marketing folks) can see the issues raised by our customers and gives them an opportunity for upselling additional services that they need base don the problems they have been having.,1
"After doing quite a lot of research I thought its a really good system, but once I started using only I started finding problems. Freshdesk is cheap, but some very important features don't work. 1-contact syncing with google doesn't work. 2- If you integrate facebook then you will have more problems than what it is worth. In my case. Messages come through after a delay and some of the messages done even come through. The integration also started creating 100's of contacts non stop. It stopped only after disconnecting the integration. I requested to delete those contacts more than a month ago and they are still there. 3-If you integrate whatsapp you cant send pictures. It creates duplicate contacts for existing contacts.4-company segmentation doesn't work. If things were clearly explained upfront there is no problem. The software is priced cheap, but it is used by customers small and big around the globe. I would say they should be more professional and should not include obvious bugs in the live release.",0
Pros:Mi è piaciuta particolarmente la flessibilità dello strumento che permette all'utente di poter creare o modificare viste in base alle esigenze aziendali.,1
Pros:The software as a service is very easy to use.It supports the ability to raise tickets in a number of ways including email.Integration is simple using REST APIs and various authentication methods.Pricing is attractive with licenses only required for agents.,1

"Pros:Freshdesk has been a breeze to set up and use effectively. My team loves how easy it is to quickly work through tickets. We heavily use Trello and their integration is top tier.When issues do come up, the support team is always available to answer my questions. Even when it doesn't support a particular workflow, I've always been given excellent suggestions to work around its limitations.",1
Overall we have derived great value from Freshdesk and it is a HUGE improvement over our previous support tool. It is fully featured with easy to use tools to help customers get answers to their questions.,1
I have realized after using ZendeskChatthat there was a lot of things and good opportunity's I had missed by not knowing the information that Zendesk Chat provides.I feel more confident in my business and I am making my costumers happier by understanding there needs faster an being able to provide the best possible service I can for my clients,1
"Pros:I like the UI on Freshdesk, It's naturalfurthermore, has you ready straight away. The siteis receptive to various screen sizes, yet thedefault size appears all good to me. That's what the underlying pageshows generally open tickets is not difficult to utilize. Somethingthat is promptly clear is the absence of being capableto perceive the number of tickets that are forthcoming/got inspecific gatherings, however not a work of art. Thereis a view in the dashboard that shows generally unsettledtickets and includes in practically like a dashboard typeview - a reward of this view is it lets you know wheretickets are forthcoming, looking out for a client or thirdparty as well so you can get a decent in general preview onwhat your help work area is doing. These are moreoverinteractive which takes you straightforwardly into a view withthe applicable tickets (in view of where you haveclicked).",1
"Freshdesk is very pleasant to use this application, it offers you everything you need in a remote and in the chat or app that are linked to it",1

It is an excellent tool I have seen in my life. You must have this software to give better customer service and make an efficient customer support team.,1
"If you are a large company, then this is probably the ticketing software for you. I would make sure I had them agree to some kind of SLA with you on any issues or questions you have before signing on the dotted line for this software because otherwise you will have a lot of frustration. The integration and adaptability of the software is awesome.",1
"Tracking support correspondence with zendesk lets us speed up issue resolution times because issues can be easily shared amongst a team, maintaining the full correspondence history and aren't delayed in someone's email inbox.I sometimes get confused about which list I'm viewing though and pricing goes up significantly once you move past a small team.We also use the integration with slack and twilio for notification of urgent issues.",1
Great tool used in our business to assist our customers.,1
"Pros:I have been using Zendesk for over 6 years and it has been fantastic. It integrates well with Slack and Jira, which are massively important to allow the support team to contact each team to raise any requests that they may have. Teams can view the support tickets and see a full history between the end user and the company, or more specifically, the support team, without the need of repeating themselves over and over again.",1

Pros:to change the e-mails to other people thats work with me,1
"It is an excellent service, but although by no means the cheapest, it is the industry standard for a reason.",1
As a small company with a big footprint we had to be able to manage any and all customer queries as soon as possible. Often this meant back and forth between us and client.The ticket system meant we never “lost” any part and any of the team could pick up on a customer question.,1

Pros:The Ticketing method with the integration is the most attractive feature of all.The reporting patterns are very good.,1
Ticketing systems feel like a war of attrition but I feel Zendesk sets up to figure out why we're getting the kinds of inquiries that we get. It's as customizable and customizable gets and we've got ours tailored to our needs.,1

We regularly use Zendesk for all my clients’ customer support needs. No other platform comes close to it.,1

"I can easily view and track my customer service inquiries quickly and efficiently.Sometimes I feel I need to spend a weekend to learn all that Zendesk can do for my organization.There are so many tool and resources, I cannot learn what they all can do while running my business at the sametime.",1
We love Freshdesk as it has made Helpdesk support seamless for us. It has made our department efficient and professional,1
I’m working in scrum team. But I’m a part of big it organization. Jira helps us to reflect complexity of our organization and help to collaborate and to track work to be done and done already. It have many reporting options. But for me there is a little bit too much of options that I’m not using - features overkill which only contaminate usability. If you could decide how to clean a view it would be great. But as I said in title - although it’s not dream software in absence of better it serves well.,0
"Easy to use good for basic customer support, missing some features as chat,phone, not great knowledge base",0
"Zendesk is a really amazing tool when it comes to customer services, since it offers a lot of features and ways to use it, it will fit every need your company might have.",1
"Zendesk est un excellent service de support.Malheureusement, en terme d'assistance technique ils sont aux abonnés absents.Alors qu'ils prévoient contractuellement une assistance téléphonique, celle-ci n'est accessible que d'eux vers leurs clients (impossible de les appeler). Il reste alors à faire une demande d'assistance avec le Chatbot le plus stupide du net ! Je cite à l'envie : demande de se connecter pour s'identifier alors que vous êtes connecté (donc impossible de s'identifier), demande de s'identifier par un code envoyé par email qui arrive une fois sur 4 et lorsque l'email arrive le code est absent (donc impossible de faire une demande), etc.Parlons enfin des délais de réponse de Zendesk : minimum 3 jours ouvrés pour obtenir une réponse le plus souvent demandant des précisions donc encore 3 jours pour avoir une réponse...En fait, il ne faut pas avoir besoin d'eux ! Si vous vous plaignez de leurs carences, ils vous proposent de vous communiquer les coordonnées d'intégrateurs !En résumé, si vous n'avez pas le budget nécessaire pour vous payer un intégrateur et que vous n'êtes pas hyper patient il vaut mieux ne pas choisir Zendesk.C'est paradoxal : un des meilleurs services de support client du marché propose à ses propres clients la pire expérience support qui soit !",0
Pros:We use Zendesk on a daily basis and it's great because it enables us to keep track of all our communication (live chat and ticket system) with our customers.,1
"Working in customer support, I have encountered many ticket management systems and all of them had at least one thing missing. When we started working with zendesk, the productivity hit the roof.1.

I’m managing help for SaaS product,1
Pros:We have recently launched QuoteSpace.co which is a rule driven quotation system.We've plugged Zoho Desk into the back end of our system to enable us to provide responsive support to our customers and to build our online knowledge base for them to access useful information about how to use the system. It was useful being able to map our company domain.Using Zoho Desk meant that QuoteSpace could focus on product development over support systems and get to market more quickly.,1
Keeping support organized.,1

Pros:The analytics have greatly increased the our effectiveness in monitoring trends in question topics and sources.,1
"Overall Zendesk is extremely useful as a customer service program, it comes through on the things you really want when it comes to making tasks easier and much more organized. Zendesk has definitely improved our own service.",1

"Pros:Il software permette di gestire in maniera semplice un progetto, grazie alle diverse sezioni in cui è possibile allocare correttamente i diversi task",1
"Pros:Zendesk is quite easy to use, very intuitive. It covers all our needs, which are the ones for a small/medium company with 2 support agents and about 15 tickets every day.",1
-Manage customer support cases on a Centralize Management Software.-Add a better option for knowledge base and project management site.,1
"The initial steps of getting everything up and running may require some extra effort and time to navigate through. When it comes to customization, I have noticed certain limitations within Zendesk Suite. While there are options available, I have found that users might feel restricted when trying to customize ticket forms, chat widget appearance, and reporting templates. Having more extensive customization options would greatly benefit businesses, as it would allow us to align the software more closely with our branding and specific requirements. This level of customization would help create a consistent and personalized experience for our customers.",1
Freshdesk allows are non technical customers to communicate without having to learn a new system.,1
Pros:The best part of Freshdesk is that it helps in assigning an email to an agent automatically.,1

Its pretty solid tool with alot of great functions and tool use to make your help desk hum along. the support page is nice to direct users to there for help or solutions.support is helpful and usually responds pretty quickly. I enjoy all the features and ease of setting up and removing users as well.,1
"i would say more live chat interaction helped to know the features but once you get the hang of it, work becomes easier, more satisfied clients",1
Solving customer complaint and management.Routing of tasks and tickets to the team.,0
"Overall, it is not a bad ticketing software.It shows its flaws in busier environments where more users are involved and program support needs specialization or customization. For a small business with minimal issues requiring base line support, this would be a good recommended option.",1
Pros:I am starting now to use service desk and until now I don´t have a opinion about this software. I will test to verify the possibility to migrate my atual service desk .,1
"we use zendesk daily for our ticketing needs, but are moving off the platform due to the incomplete and terrible reporting, UI issues and death by a thousand cuts due to nickle and diming people for access",0
"This is a simple to use, yet robust helpdesk platform that we currently utilize in two different departments within my org (IT and Maintenance), to make ticket creation and management simple.I also use this as an example when other helpdesk vendors ask me what it would take to get my business - if they can't at least match the features and price, there's no reason to have that discussion.We're customers of both the free and paid version (two separate helpdesks in use), but the introduction of both within my organization have been overwhelmingly received as positive, and our maintenance department sings its praises almost daily.",1
"If you're using it for one single landing page or a very specific purpose, Zendesk chat is great for that. But if you want a chat software that does a lot of different things - like customer support on one page, sales on another, and tech help on another -- it's really hard to do without a developer. At the price we are paying, Zendesk chat is becoming long in the tooth. And we're still waiting on another chat software to change our minds.",1
Estamos encantados con la herramienta. Nos ha ayudado a optimizar muchísimo nuestra atención al cliente.,1
"Pros:The dashboard is beautiful, takes less time to try figure out the features.It’s user friendly is something I like, I dislike those tools with very complicated processes and Zoho Desk is definitely the best with very simple and clear language. Easily customizable to fit your needs. Zoho Desk has really helped us to answer clients queries on time and this has greatly and positively impacted our productivity. When a customer is happy with the services he or she will refer others and we could be more happier with Zoho Desk. Live chat feature helps us answer and sort queries in real time. Fairly priced compared to similar tools. Free plan is very thoughtful and you can always start with this as your progress to the paid version for more features. Ticket creation is fast and easy. Zoho Desk integrates well with other Zoho products",1

"We save lot of time in our answers and we can also, at the time we have our support department answering the problems or doubts, have one portal customer which provide us a better image in front of our customers",1
Pros:It was my pleasure to work with ZenDesk software. I even help them to translate to Bulgarian version. One of the most important thing for customer service software is the ability to searching and finding information for the person you are serving at the time of communication. It is crucial when this communication is over the phone. Thanks to their outstanding UX support agents are capable to find everything related with the person in no time. Integrations with 3rd party apps are essential but not so important. The thing is WHY these apps are paid? WHY? Why I need to move to the upper level of my subscription to use a specific integration. There is no sense.,1
Very good. Using for all our support tickets and interactions.,1
"Pros:Easy to use, easy to configure, easy to train internal team members on how to use and set up workflow; great visualizations and ability to track and trend issues is unparalleled",1

Pros:Many 3rd party integrations make it is easy to incorporate help desk tickets directly into your companies systems.Easy to use for agents.,1

Pros:We shopped around a ton for different solutions and Zendesk Chat is by far the best deal when it comes to chat widgets.,1
"+Easy to use from the boxPredifined templates, custom portal-Russian language is not supported in cloud versionBenefits:We use JIRA Service Desk to support our customers using ERP systems. Jira helps us to relpy on customer's needs quick and to track the hystory",1
One stop shop,1
Management and consumer complaint resolution. Task and ticket assignment to the team. Contacting customer support personnel and receiving quick replies is easy with Zendesk. It has an easy-to-use Livechat feature that helps expedite the customer assistance process.,1
I am overall pleased with Zendesk. I would like to be able to email outside the company and attach documents easier,1
"Overall Jira Service Desk has been a fantastic tool to help organise our company internally with IT tasks and help requests, as well as capturing client help requests and issues to build up our knowledge base and provide it as a go to source of information for help on our software outside the phone.",1
Excellent,1
"I think I sum it up in my PRO category box. I can put my questions or needs out to my clients,casting directors,market research teams-and so much more, while trusting in the relay of internal messages and support. Many who don't look would be surprisedI bet to see that Zendesk handles so many life related communication needs on both sides of the fence. A truly easier approach when having to speak directly voice to voice for servicing is not necessary or conduciveto the concern.",1
Very Good Software . need resolution for the above cons.,1
"Quicker Ticket flow, and remote assisting made this software a huge plus for us!",1
"Customer service, general website questions, real time help",1
"I am a Front-end developer, and Freshdesk honestly makes it so much easier for me to manage prioritize and delegate a variety of tickets. Being able to track KPIs, and monitor how my team is doing, and keep historical information in one area with a pretty decent search tool. So I am very happy my organization chose to stay with Freshdesk.",1

Great.,1
Pros:It has all the new fancy screens the look smooth.It is a solid option if you are running a small support department on a budget.There are affordable options the do give you the full operations to run a support operation.,1
"I've been working with Zendesk for 4 years now. In my LOB we use it to reply to emails and track escalations. It has all the tools that we need to track the escalations, and solve emails. Since we handle different company, we have the option to filter this information. One of my favorite features is that we can assign emails to specific people. The filtering process it's also nice, because it helps getting the information needed faster. The way we have it setup is that we have different ways to see the companies we work with, the amount of pending emails, and the amount of responses. Having all those reports, help us when informing our coworkers about their progress.",1
"Pros:Having used Zendesk as an alternative to other options, here are my thoughts on it:1) Zendesk is good at integrating multiple communication channels into one place. Unlike other options, using social media channels is included in the cost. With Zendesk the social media channels are included in the per user cost, so you are only paying for other features like Knowledgebase or Live Chat, or the bundled option.2) Cost per user is fairly reasonable compared to other solutions we looked at. For us the cost per user was really important because while we may need fancy features, we wanted to make sure we did not end up spending more money for features or services we really didn't need. 3) Third party app support - We were able to choose and integrate with third party tools using the App directory. This helps to add functionality that may not be included in the core Zendesk product.",1
"Pros:Zendesk's support site is really robust, so if something isn't customized right out of the box the way you want it.Zendesk has various automations, you can set macros (which is text you frequently send) and they've slowly incorporated lots of support related channels so ensure you can represent your customer's preferences through chat, talk, or email.They have features, like Answer Bot, to try to push AI to decrease customer reliance on your customer support agents.I like that as an admin I can know nothing but pretty quickly put together a robust customer support solution.",1
"Pros:free trial feature, add-ons,support is very good, all the needed features in 1 place no need to use other software. ability to import and export data.",1
Zendesk is super easy to use and to communicate with different other teams is very easy.verygood customer support and it has 24/7 support .Zendesk has a great job in seriously improving their product listening to their customers and releasing new features to make their customers feel very happy. it is fully featured and comprehensive .,1
"Pros:It is simple and straightforward to use. I can put together a ticket quickly, while at the same time I can read tickets and various queues to find work that needs to be done.",1

Moreover, notifications can be received, and requests can be tracked on mobile and tablet devices outside of working hours, allowing for the prioritization of urgent requests. Essentially, this application serves as a centralized hub for managing all internal job demand situations, and I am thoroughly pleased with its performance.",1
FreshDesk was implemented before I took over ticket management within our business but I instantly saw a platform with potential to gather customised insight to aid us in our continuous improvement. The customer support team are always prompt and helpful. Couldn't recommend them enough!,1

I needed billing support from them, and my ticket was 'escalated' to the Finance department, but nobody ever got back to me in time. Literally a few days went by and not one word from my Zendesk agent. They have a poor support system. So, if you don't ever need help with anything and know what you're doing, then ZD is probably for you.",1
I appreciate that we can utilize Zendesk as a one-stop-shop and not have to have different platforms for other job functions.,1
My overall experience with Freshdesk has been very positive. We have it implemented as our ticketing system for IT issues and are looking into expanding the ticketing portion to other departments.,1

Centralization of the support. A place to follow everything.,1
nice,1
Overall ease of management,1
We've utilized this product for customer backing and administrations and it's whenever we first were utilizing comparative programming to analyze customer activities grounded on explicit models. The education wind is for nontechnical individuals thus one ought to comprehend the semantics of every tab.,1
It was really good until it was bad. If they had been able to not filter our customer's emails we might still be with them. But LiveAgent is a much better service so I'm almost grateful it was so bad otherwise we wouldn't know how good an email service could actually be.,1
"We use Freshdesk for Citizen Support and for internal support to our government portal editors. We don't push Freshdesk to its limits, rather do what I'd call a basic use, but it does what you need it to do.",1

It's good but there are better also for free,0

Business users have a single interface to work with that is simple and only shows them the information that they need.,1
Ease of use and community work and keeping connected which is what we are after so are very grateful for the platform that is here to help us do this.,1

"Pros:Facilité pour fusionner les tickets, retrouver des contacts. Rangement par dossiers. La création de modèles pour les emails est très simple.",1
"My overall experience with SNOW has been good. There are platforms that are equally good, if not slightly better, but this would be my choice if I was running an organization of 1000+ employees. The user journeys can be confusing but if the pages are set up correctly and maintained, this app can be a boon for companies who are encouraging using SNOW and treating it as a homepage for all internal sites (like a company intranet). The platform allows third party integrations with Okta, Slack and Salesforce and also custom applications that can be hosted and run off SNOW.",1
"We needed a way to take in user issues and then sort them into the teams that need to handle them. Service desk provides a great interface for our current issue tracking system, so it was a no-brainer.",1

My overall experience was excellent. Zendesk is a very solid and well made software that's easy to use and convenient.,1
"Pros:Es ist intuitiv, leicht zu verstehen und hat die meisten Funktionen die man braucht",1
"If you are a company that cares about treating your customers well - this is not the product for you.A litmus test that we missed - Jira does not care about customer support, so how could you expect them to truly understand the problems of companies that use it.",0
"Pros:* very intuitive, one needs hardly any documentation to successfully use and administer it* good, customizable notifications system* nice looking reports* instant support via chat window",1
I use it for client management.,1
"Since I've been using it for years and now I am confident using the tool, great. But there's a steep learning curve for admins. For agents, this is Amazing. Barely a training is needed, very straight forward. There are a LOOOT of integrations available which is great.",1
"Project management(agile) of the IT team (different developer, a manager...)",1

It is a very good application.You manage your work and get thingsdone✔I love it,1
"Pros:The unique thing which Freshdesk offers and others do not is that they offer the ability to forward a ticket/conversation to a third person (outside your organization and agents) without letting the requester of the ticket know. I have not found this functionality in any other helpdesks I have used so far. Also, their support is very responsive and puts every bit of their knowledge to solve the issues.",0
"Zoho Desk is such a great feature to add to your line of customer support tools. You can easily integrate it directly with other Zoho Products (CRM, Mail, Chat, ect) and it's a seamless integration.Zoho Desk support team is great, They provide friendly and top of the line services and they get back to their customers at their earlier (which is a few hours) .",1

Is it to create tickets for discussing with clients.,1
"While there are a couple of issues with Zendesk, overall I find it a far preferable option to dealing with these tickets through e-mail, Slack, or a personal basis (barring cases where this would be the better solution). If you are getting enough volume of tickets that support ticket software seems like it'd help your business, you can afford to get it.",1
"Pros:Ringcentral integration is nice but not perfect but it is the leading factor for me at this time. Though there are a few bugs with the implementation, I would love to get a training on how to better use it.",0

"Overall, this is a great tool for service teams. Managers will enjoy the dashboard view of metrics and the customizable queues.",1
"Pros:The software is simple, and user friendly with ability to customize it.the main objective of software is mainly to mange customer service, but in my case, I used it for internal ticketing system for bank employees to send their maintenance requests to the maintenance officer. Zoho Desk contains a customer portal with minimum needed functions to send and view requests. I can customize the colors and tabs names and views.Contains lots of reporting views and lists in multiple filtering options.",1
We can manage our internal process so well by using it.,1
"I have been using Zendesk for over 3.5 years and I find it pretty simple to use.The fact that you can respond via email is helpful as an agent for rapid troubleshooting and responding.Overall, I have had a pretty positive experience and just successfully integrated it into our single sign-on provider.Some areas to improve would be a shortcut to marking an issue as Solved.This could be helpful instead of having to log in to close issues.Additionally many users reply thanks when you close an issue and this automatically re-opens the issue which can be tedious for agents.",1
"We have technology products and B2B customers. For any issues or bugs and for any support required, customers contact us via Zoho support. We have provided this tool to our customers. This has been a great tool as it has helped us in measuring and optimizing our support service and then, deliver that in a better way.",1

In addition, my clients do not need great knowledge of IT and can through the apps, access the ticket portal from virtually any platform (facebook, twitter, among others) thanks to its natural integration.",1
"This is a solution that provides our customers with the most effective and personalized attention. It has facilitated and improved the complex work of customer service, making it a much simpler, proactive and productive process.",1
"We implemented the free Sprout version of Freshdesk as a replacement for the old system of having team members log in to a shared email box. It has been transformative to be able to see what's been touched already, by whom, and what was said. We no longer have to worry about customer emails getting missed because everyone assumed someone else took care of them, or because they got pushed to another page and forgotten. Beyond that, their customer service has been very responsive and helpful, even though we're currently on the free plan.",1

Very poor. The salesman was supportive and energetic when he signed us up. After we signed a year contract ALL support disappeared. You cannot get anyone on the phone at this company.

"JIRA Service Management offers a robust service desk and ITSM solution with powerful ticketing capabilities, integration with JIRA, knowledge base features, and reporting capabilities. However, organizations should consider the complexity for non-technical users, the learning curve, limited customer experience features, and the pricing structure when evaluating JIRA Service Management for their support and ITSM needs.",1
"We can use this data to improve the client experience by putting new processes in place. We've increased our output significantly, and now everything is in plain sight.

Change Management and incidents are easy to manage with this tool,1
"Great at first, but our company outgrew zendesk due to issues they just couldn’t solve for us.",1
"My organisation needs an integrated solution for Sales, Operations and Finance to provide efficiencies and ease of use as we scale and grow. Zoho Books, CRM and Desk pretty much deliver what we need with some slight limitations around Desk integration. This is functional, cost effective software which will allow my organisation to grow to a point without breaking the bank.As a start up we need to have functionality whilst watching the pennies.",1
"Very useful software, customer experiences are powerful and innovative as it helps to connect successfully. It's everything you need in one package. I recommend it 100%",1
Pros:All my experiences with the ZenDesk was extremely positive. They really make it easy to run a help desk.,1
Zendesk has been an astounding tool! You have every one of the choices you want to work all the more proficiently and as a feature of a group. It has such countless highlights that you find constantly new choices to further develop the work in the group. It is easy to use and it has an unmistakable connection point. It helped our team to achieve success in our business.,1
"I have this problem, the grass is always greener, and I jump between service applications a lot. I have used and left freshdesk a couple times, hoping something would be the be-all-end-all to make my life easier. In the end I always come back to Freshdesk and pickup where I left off, and wonder why I left in the first place. In the end, Freshdesk does all I NEED it to do, and much of what I WANT it to do, and the gap between need and want shrinks every year.",1
De las mejores opciones para la gestión de proyecto y reducción de tiempos en la gestión de trabajo,1
Keeping track of support issues and making sure they are resolved in an acceptable time frame,1

Easy setup during an immediate need for a new support/case system.,1
"Pros:C'est une solution de services informatiques qui fournit la gestion des actifs informatiques, la surveillance et gestion du réseau. Il est doté d'une interface simple et attirante avec des fonctionnalités innovantes",1
Pros:Great as a start up product. Overall enjoyable experience with wonderful applications.,1
"Pros:This software allows me to take calls, handle tickets, handle chats and review my internal resources in one place! Different departments have different queues to keep everyone's work separated and with a quick switch of an assignee, you can escalate or deescalate tickets as needed. The software allows the creation of macros/canned responses that can be limited to specific teams but are easily accessible whether it be for a ticket or a chat. The phone call plug in and chat plug ins are easily accessible as well, and can be deactivated for users who should not have access to those features. The chat and phone call notifications are loud and consistent so an agent won't ever miss a service request (unless due to negligence or poor connection). You can customize how many chats an agent should handle at a time and how long an agent can get 'wrap up' time after a call. Tickets are automatically populated after a phone call or chat has been established so an agent can follow up with a customer after they've spoken with them in real time. Other features of Zendesk that I like is it can be used as a help center for FAQs and an onboarding site. So you can use it for job postings to outline the criteria for jobs or gigs and for the application.",1
Once we got our heads around the rather clunky and busy UI we've realized just how useful JIRA is.It's now the Universities ticket manager of choice and is used by every member of support staff.No other ticket manager (that we've found) comes close to the features offered by JIRA.,1
Works well for organizing customer requests for a support or development team. Features are very limited in the basic package and upgrading causes the costs to go up dramatically.,1
"For me, its a whole new world of running a contact centre - without the need for a PABX, Switch, T-servers, diallers, hard phones, softphone apps, ethernet cables, phone pins, time sheets, etc. I can run my team from a browser window with no need for IT support and my agents can do their job from any computer anywhere in the world #mindblown",1
organized my customer service process,1
Pros:Ease of configuration and overall use.I had our entire team setup and trained within a few hours.The customer portal is great as well.,1

Pros:When we looked to create our backoffice infrastructure we looked at Zoho CRM. From there we quickly were drawn into a full service platform.,0
Zendesk is our Customer Service management platform. Would never recommend it as a solution!,0
Overall experience is neutral as it is very static kind of service and cannot allow much manual interventions.,1
I've had to take some time to learn this application although once I knew the basics on how to navigate within the application it became easier to understand,1
Pros:snippets so far seem kind of useful. Cant compare this to other desk software platforms though as I dont have the experience.,0

As above works well having various platforms in one place.,1

It just didn't live up to expectations,0
Great solution that helps organize work and keeps important case related items out of email.,1
"Pros:Like that you are able to create a ticket for your needs, but limited on the issues that you can pick from",0
"This plugin lets you manage several conversations at once, so you can always be present for those site visitors who are most likely to convert. With premium (paid) you can set up triggers that let you reach out to every visitor automatically, so you’re more available to hold in-depth conversations with serious prospects. You can use the chat system on your mobile device thanks to dedicated mobile apps and you can use the included analytics to assess how visitors use your website. You can also easily customize it to reflect your site’s design and color scheme.",1
"I've had a positive experience working with Zendesk on a regular basis as the support platform for our internal users. So far, I've enjoyed how Zendesk sends alerts and how the ticket has handled the platform with simplicity of job completion, attaching material, and keeping a track of users and tickets.",1

"With this software, our company is able to assist over thousands of customers on a daily basis with they equipment.",1
"We are a small company, it took us a afternoon to setup a free plan and a customer support portal. After 3 years all our customers are posting their issues to the portal, we can alternate three people in replying, all issues are kept track of with the entire history (that was getting lost in several email chains with different people before Freshdesk). At the end of the year we get some basic statistics about how good we have been in respecting SLA. We can divide tickets by customer, product, etc. We are evaluating to upgrade because the other plans are still cheap and are much richer of statistics and channels.",1
"Pros:The ability to automate - we run daily reports, these have become an automatic task. We are able to track our work and look for 'Bottlenecks' in our process. From here we can fix any issues and increase our productivity.",1
"Pros:Simple - outofthebox - features to make daily work easier. Pro SLAs , easy to configure Portal and automation rules",1
"An awe-inspiring tool that allows us to use it in so many ways, as a helpdesk, as a tasks manager, and as a dispatch.It does well to do most of what other providers give you for very little cash.",1
"In short, Zoho Desk has enabled us to raise the level of the service center for assistance provided to our customers, and indeed, the response time has improved, and the distribution of tasks to team members has become easier.

Overall its a great tool to have experience with when working as SME or platform engineer as its the widely and extensively used tool for tracking purposes.,1
There are numerous features and numerous ways to communicate with a potential customer base. It was shockingly simple and seamless for me to integrate it into my website as a web developer. We see a lot of potential for streamlining our sales process to reduce data entry work and reach more customers regularly without the intrusive phone call and contact form that many of the younger clientele in these markets are avoiding.,1

"Managing a major website replacement project. Invaluable to keep the team on track, working fast and agile.",1
Pros:Simple enough to use. Pretty intuitive. Fine for basic use.,0
"Zoho Desk is a great tool with many features, it seems some features may need ironing out or better documenting but otherwise it is a very useful tool that could be extremely valuable to many businesses in all different industries and niches. It is perfect for anyone who just wants a simple email ticketing solution but for those wanting to use the help desk knowledgebase solutions you may want to set aside some time to fully understand how it works and how to best use it.",0
Pros:Easy to use help desk software! We love this for our customer service for our small(e-commerce) business.We also greatly utilize the knowledge base for our customers to hopefully find their answers before needing to email us. The ticketing system works very well for us.,1

"Al realizar los testing se podian encontrar todos los escenarios para un determinado grupo de empleados, de manera facil y de igual forma se puede ir actualizando el estado de las pruebas y poner detalles de alguna prueba que no haya podido completado.",1
I was able to set up Macros and were able to use them on the mobile client. This made updating/closing tickets fast and easy and the clients notified right away.,1
It has been a very good decision of moving to Freshdesk. We have improved a lot after switching to Freshdesk for our support,1
It is very excellent and I recommend it to many companies that my friends and other companies work with,1
"Una gran elección para empresas medianas, tanto por precio como por funcionalidades",1
"The experience with Zendesk is very good, it has helped me to better organize the incidents, give them priority and also be able to obtain very good statistics to analyze the work of the team.",1
Pros:Super software and easy to use The ticketing system is awesome and has helped us increase customer satisfaction.,1
"Pros:I can control mi technicians and their work, create tickets from social networks, emails and on site. Great web forms to create tickets.",1
ServiceNow allows customization and automation on an unprecedented scale for 3rd party software. It takes runt work away from technicians so they can focus on projects.,1
"All issues related with our hardware and software are logged and tracked byt creating tickets.Customers can follow-up tickets themselves, and issues that come back often can be moved to a knowledge base (some kind of FAQ) to lower the support load. It has good features to divide tickets between our products and departments.",1
"Overall, I've had a great time working with Jira. The ability to send us email updates when our request was successfully submitted and when there is an update to our request for new equipment is its most notable feature. Undoubtedly a way to speed up the reporting of issues. Also, the interface with Outlook is excellent.",1
The application is easy to use and it met our business needs,1
Pros:I love that the email program gives you a certain amount of free use before requiring a purchase. I have been able to instantly make use of the service and I know that I will continue using it under a paid plan as my company grows. I am also able to recommend it to start up clients who are working hard to add professionalism to their brand while not yet having the cash flow. Having a great email host that grows with the business is a huge benefit.,1
"We needed an efficient CRM system, easy to set up an with easy access to analytics to manage our tickets and Freshdesk was able to give us that and more. We love that its features are based on time; we are able to measure agent and team performance on this.",1

"Pros:A lot of configuration possibilities, accesses. Easy to track issue progress.",1
ease of addressing tickets and change requests,1
"Pros:I use two different software for customer service application, one is the ZOHO Desk. I adore ZOHO due to its much possibility for integration with other very useful ZOHO products. This allows increased productivity and better customer relations in my part. With ZOHO Desk, the initial price offers just and great features that are not limiting at all. The customer feedback collection allows so much management for received feedbacks. The interface looks clean and very sleek as well. A very organized look allows ease of use of the product.",1
Speed and efficiency,1
"Since we used Zendesk, the resolution time of our support tickets has been reduced considerably. Also, this platform provided us with new communication channels as a knowledge base, so that our clients could solve some common problems on their own.",1
"This is a love and hate affair. Service Desk is extraordinary software and its capabilities broad. But it's not for the faint of heart. If we could start over we'd pause to learn, then plan, and plan very carefully. This is a project, not something you setup in your afternoon following a lunch break. And with any project, its success is measured in its planning. But learn Service Desk before planning because with the knowledge of what it's truly capable of, you'll be able to build a very powerful service desk solution. My only gripe is that it's not intuitive. We work amongst high level developers who also fumble their way around Service Desk, taking way too long to find what they need. There are workarounds such as bookmarking key screens, but without this approach you easily become lost in the deep levels of available screens and admin areas. Navigation is too complex.",1
It's been received well. Other departments within the company are adopting it.,1
"It is really amazing and easy to use for live chats and customer management. I use it for presales, visitor, and customer management for my daily use. It has been really great using it till date.",1
"Pros:The solution seems to work well and at scale. Our setup receives roughly 4,000 inbound emails per day with no issues. The scenario automation feature is also easy to setup and fairly intuitive.",1
We use this software to help our customers and partners who need support for our app.,1
"Overall, a great tool to help with customer issue support and escalation!",1
Very happy with this software. It has made our customer service dept perform so much better!,1
"Overall, it's very effective for managing customer interactions and customer support.",1
"overall experience is good, have used other crm tools as well but this one is more user friendly and modern. daily base needs made easy and less time consuming at the same time",1
"Pros:Cloud based, nicely documented and full of features . Allows customized developments, with Dulge programming, it is very easy to implement routines. A real operating system for business",1
En general es una manera de tener el control de las incidencias o solicitudes reportadas para su revisión,1
I standarized my support system.,1
"Pros:Zendesk is basically a customer-facing web interface that has been developed to provide robust reporting and advanced analytics to businesses. The software provides personalized customer support at both public and private forums. You can easily export your ticket views to CSV. You are also offered multi-channel support on e-mail, web, phone, chat, and social media. Salesforce and SugarCRM are pre-built in the software.",1
"Pros:Initially, we evaluated Freshdesk and Zendesk. We had heard a lot about ZenDesk, but as a startup, we didn't like the cost impact of using that platform. Freshdesk had all of the features we were looking for (Phone support, email ticketing, customer forums & knowledge base, groups & user management) but the system was significantly more cost effective. After implementing the system I have heard nothing but good feedback from our support team.",1
Overall experience with Zoho Desk that they will be there for you support 24/7,1
Super intuitive to pick up and use from the get go. It was extremely easy to set up the entire team and inform them on how to utilize the basic features of Zoho Help Desk.,1
Pros:application that allowed us to manage the problems on the development of the software.,1
Positive. We switched from HubSpot and haven't looked back. Highly recommend.,1
"Greater efficiency in responding to customer requests. We are also able to collaborate better as a team, improving internal workflows. Finally, we are able to leverage and update help content so that our customers are served up the most relevant information.",1
Its really a simple to use application which assists my organization in collation and processing of clients realtime data. This helped my organization in organizing our services and making improved responses to customer complaints and this definitely built a considerable amount of trust. Thumbs up to Zendesk,1
"Overall, Jira Service Desk provides a well rounded package for anyone looking to build a customer portal for helpdesk-type teams. It's an excellent choice if your company is already using Jira Software or Jira Business because the use workflow and editing workflow are very familiar and are one in the same for many things (e.g. Workflows & Screens)",1
"Pros:Most features aloows you to model your business with almost no problem. Because the app is so big, we haven´t found yet something important the apllication can´t do.",1
Ability to assure my customers that their issues will be addressed,1
"Great result for the business, especially when we seek customer satisfaction.",1
"OTRS offered one of the most , if not the most ,bang for the buck in my opinion. The support was always on point and promptly responded to all of or requests andquestions , they provided on site support when needed and had one of the most pleasant training experience thus far.",1
Pros:We use our chat feature more often than our phone calls- customers seem to really like being able to chat more than pick up the phone these days. Love that any of our agents can join the chat when needed to give feedback or a helping hand to the chat.,1
We guide or whole IT ticketing service through Freshdesk and have setup a real helpdesk webpage via Freshdesk.,1
Pros:The software is very flexible and seems set up well for any sized organization.,1

Pros:ability to track FIFO tickets and help resolve customer issues quickly. Ability to automatically submit surveys upon completion of tickets. Ability to track agent performance.,1
Pros:The platform is relatively user friendly and has a sufficient number of features to work well.,0
"Zendesk provides a good ticket management system, knowledge base platform (hosting documents) with security-based permissions and insights. Comparing to competitors such as Freshdesk or Jira, even though they are cheaper, they can't provide the functionalities that Zendesk provides. Zendesk allows us to perfectly track our cases, analyze the performance through insights allowing us to understand what we have to improve in order to improve our customer CSAT.",1
"I was having issues keeping up with my work, I guess you could say I am a fixer. If its broke or doesn't work, I'm the person you call. I am the only person in my department, so I was getting post it notes, calls, chats, texts, even people stopping me in the hallway telling me something they needed fixed. With over 70 employees it was a lot. I often lost a post it note or forgot that so and so saidin the hall this wasn't working. With Zendesk I just create a ticket and viola its there until I get around to it. No more lost notes or forgetting what someone said.",1
"Pros:Ticket customization and best automation tools to respond customers. The UI interface is very easy to use. Customer service is the best in class as they come up with resolution very fast. Tracking of customer complain is easy, email, live chat.SMS are the best features available in this tools.",1
"Pros:I've been using Zendesk for over four years, for the first two years we used it as an IT helpdesk, we were able to assign tickets to colleagues, categorize with type, and prioritize with SLAs. We now use this platform in collaboration with another company but from a customer's perspective. I find it easy to raise tickets, as well as looking at any pending/open tickets I have. I also like the fact I can search by the organization and see other tickets my colleagues have raised.",1
"Pros:facil usar bom impacto, tendo melhor agilidade",1
Organization,1
Pros:Works without VPN.Nothing I really like about it compared to other systems.,0
"Pros:It's set up well and has a usable mobile app, unlike some other products",1
I love the automation part and this makes it much more productive compared to a regular Jira board. So I can only recommend it.,1
I still use Zendesk Daily. It is fantastic to mage a largeumber of clients. It allows me to keep track by setting tasks on clients and deals. It allows me to create multiple deals per client which is also very useful. Highly recommend.,1
"If you want all clients information in one place and easy to use, Zoho desk is for you.",1
good and bad. If used correctly and programmed to a specific company it can be useful.,0
"Zoho Desk has enabled us to interact in an innovative way with customers and increased the cooperation of team members to ensure that all open tickets are closed and all inquiries are answered in the specified times and without delay, which raised the level of satisfaction of our customers with the rapid response to them.",1
Pros:It's got a ton of options and features. It can be customized in a lot of ways and they're working hard on improving it. There's been a steady stream of great new features for a long time.,1
customer communication has been good,1
"Pros:Ease of use, integration is simple, and the ability to fully customize it to your needs within reason. I like that it's easy to assign user groups and the simplicity in managing teams.",1
Zendesk helped our customer support team to become an efficient machine. Knowing exactly how many tickets needed to be tended to and the importance each was something that a regular email inbox could not have taken care of.,1
"My experience was good, but since there is no community version anymore I'm moving to another one.",0
I work with itto manage my work and to build and track the application without wasting my time this is good software to work with it,1
"Very, very disappointed.I would not recommend this company to anyone.",0
Amazing!,1
"We use FreshDesk for Helpdesk and support call processing to our Customer Base which is over 2,500 customers in the USA. Overall we love the product and it has helpd us create and maintain a much more efficient support team and process for our customers.",1
"Pros:i love this app, it's helping our group (of 5 companies) to support our costumers using all canals web, phone and more",1
"Pros:1. This application comes with all the usual Atlassian goodies - customizations of screens(what elements like dropdowns and their contents) to customization or workflows(screens and/or status).2. Plus the integrations, with other JIRA/Atlassian products is a major plus - not that it is hard to connect to other vendors' applications.3. Pricing is another major advantage. So even if you are a 10-15 member team in a big company or a 15 odd people company - you have the right pricing slot.4. Atlassian have also improved their security with whitelist and also with features for data collection/integration/gathering - you can be sure of the data security, with strict control on exposing only what is needed to external world.5. Ease of customization is also a major plus with this.",1
We are now able to create an omnichannel experience for our customers.,1
Simplified Helpdesk to offer customers and handle support ticket flow,1
"Good system, if a little basic, have struggled to create reports and 1 or 2 problems importing databases. The customer support back up is a little slow",1
"It was amazing, by using my pc i used to log ineveyday morning at 10 am to log out at 7pm , we use this application for marking attendences n our leave holidays paid leave unpaid leave, salary slip also we can get from this application",1
The helpdesk and features combined with it made it the perfect solution for a school that receives lots of communication from areas of school. It allows us all to have one place where we can collate all our knowledge and see work that we are all working. This allows us to easily cover for other staff when they are off. The reports were also very insightful and progressive for our department,1
Love that we are able to keep all customer communications organized and easily accessed for review of the customer life cycle!,1
The ability to index issues and recall them at a later date.,1
Pros:Its really easy to use and get the exact time you work,0
"An absolute waste of time trying to implement these services into my companies. I don't even know where to start - but it's evident the developer team behind the service does very little to maintain scripts and codebases used within their apps - as it is next to impossible to easily incorporate anything into your existing webspaces.I have been working on implementing their services for over 4 hours now, when I was able to complete the same plus more on Zoho in half that time. I understand for the last time why I have not, will not, and do not ever want to entertain using their services EVER again.Seems as if they tout the fact they are 'leading customer service solution provider' but I think they are confusing the services they provide for others vs users needing support from them - because if it was the ladder, it would totally make sense.If their dismally written and executed docs don't help you (they wont) then you can look forward to chatting with their dumb bot, that forces you to go through 5 min of pre-screening before even routing your support request, which once received will only be responded too ever 10 min, and if it's a ticket, expect a response after 6 hours.Not sure how this company stay on top (other than the fact they offer solicited reviews in exchange for more time) but as a social media influencer I will be sure to make sure as many people stay away from this company as they can.",0
Pros:Trial version handles most important issues,1
Company Visibility across multiple departments. A centralized repository for contact's. The ability to manage our pipeline,1
Prompt and efficient,0
Pros:So far my experience using the CRM module was satisfactory. I found the ticket management system well you could not ask for an easier system to use,1
excelent,1
The Zoho Desk system is very intuitive because it can be set up to match what the platform needs like relevant customer behavior which is vital in anticipating the needs of our customer.,1
Pros:It's very easy to use and operate as a single person and also as a team. Very happy with the support as well.,1
"With Zendesk Suite, I was able to resolve customer's app-related issues which really helps both me and the company. I was able to earn incentives with the customer satisfaction I am getting and the company is able to gain more customers given the good customer service they are receiving and this is all with the help of Zendesk Suite. Couldn't have thought of any other tool we can use that can be easily navigated and has most of the features that we need.",1
Overall excellent,1
Initial setup can be complex but it can also be super powerful if you are able to configure it properly. It's visual scripting and workflow tool is really capable and easy to learn,1
"When we started of as a small organization, we needed an internal IT help desk to be set up, that is robust, with enough tracking and reporting. Most of the big names in the market were not affordable for us then, however FreshDesk had something that was just the right price, and met all the important requirements.",1
"Numerous extraordinary things to like about the suit, yet certainly the incredible client care experience is the main that rings a bell as each time I had an issue and have been in touch with the item support group, I've had the option to find solutions and arrangements rapidly and with fulfilling replies to my inquiries. Likewise, the chance of including various undertakings inside a similar work area has been extremely useful in working with the centralization of data. Commercial center applications and various joining prospects which helps project the board",1
Help me a lot for my helpdesk department.,1
"JSD offers a lot for any company needing to maintain a service desk to manage thesupport requests it handles from its clients/customers. Because it is a Jira (Atalassian) product, it is most likely utilized along with other Jira tools, and plays quite well with those. Due to this integration aspect, thought, the layers of security necessitated within user settings requires a considerable amount of learning/training, which is not easily attained without paying for it from Atalassian. And, while I understand, respect (and even applaud) the market-oriented principle of this, it does seem a bit intentional that there are no reliable helps available outside of Atlassian (for example, any tutorials you will find on YouTube for assisting with certain user configs, settings, steps, etc. are applicable to much older versions of the software, and to a great extent, are not applicable to the current version). This would not be a negative aspect if Jira did a much better job at keeping their own internal (free) help docs, etc. up to date, so as to apply to the current version, as well.Instead, if one wants highly dependable helps it appears the best way to achieve that is to pay Atlassian for their training courses (at prices that are obviously calibrated toward larger companies/corporations. And blindly undertaking such would seem risky if judged by the extent to which their free user tools are kept up to date.This is not, to my knowledge, the common experience with most apps.",1
"We started using Freshdesk because the cost was reasonable relative to the features offered.It is better than our previous solution overall, but some features initially promised as part of the sale were never delivered.Quality has visibly diminished over time.We would never have selected Freshdesk knowing what we do today.",0
"Ever since we started to use, we hit on so many bugs that in my opinion this product is not yet matured and Atlassian have been very poor in handling the bugs/suggestion request. Infact a lot of bugs are categorized as Suggestions. I would not recommend this product to anyone even if it's free.Unless Atlassian gets a grip on the huge backlog of tickets and improve their communication channel over the tickets.",0
Pros:Gängiges und intuitives Tool. Kenne kein vergleichbares am Markt.,1
"First off, the free trial is a big thanks. Second, it help us to make little changes that improve our service",1
Pros:Love the new clean layout and all of the features. Perfect for small businesses looking for a pro level customer service app.,1
"With Zendesk, we centralised our ticket management and enabled a steady inflow of new tasks coming from our clients and managers before they head the development portion of the team.",1
Abysmal,0
I have to use this software for more than three years though not consecutively but I have been able to deploy it because has features for modification and for proper customer support management. On the side of life chat it supports two messages and also I normally use it in email marketing.,1
"Highly recommended as a customer support solution. Tracking tasks across the project and giving internal resources and clients insight for a full picture of project status.Great for clients looking for that initial solution that is easy to get started with, cost-effective and adoptable by staff and clients (intuitive to use!)",1
"Pros:JIRA Service Desk is a customer-first application. The integration with the Confluence knowledge base is excellent and the tool as a whole provides a streamlined, dead simple customer experience. Launching your first project only takes about a week--very speedy return on investment!There are tons of add-ons in the Atlassian ecosystem that help extend functionality if there's something the tool won't do out-of-the-box.Atlassian support has been responsive and helpful every time I've had to reach out to them.",1
Pros:The amount of features that JIRA has allows for our team to use it to track a multitude of ticket/project types.,0
Managing and tracking tenant repair issues. The main benefit is we have a full paper trail and seem to always know where we are with our team.,1
"It's a robust platform thatMy only immediate complaints are occasional service outages that always seem to impact us at high priority times, and not having more control over certain ticket types reacting dynamically(for example if a set ticket reason code required certain values or fields to be filled out).",1
"It gets the job done, but for the price I would not personally recommend this. Searching for anything in there is a complete nightmare and I just think there's probably better options for this price range.",0
"The only benefit we really get from Fresh Desk is a system to track new tickets.Older ones were migrated poorly, nothing is searchable by text, there is no support from their team, and we have frequent performance degradation issues. This was a regrettable decision which we are looking to rectify now.",0
Pros:The format of the ticket interface lends its self to serving email based communications very well. At a glance I can easily see all tickets sent by a specific requester or business and prioritize based on the severity of the issues being described. The help center and chat button that can be integrated into custom applications can be a game changer when it comes to self service. Inbound and outbound call recordings are super critical especially for our finance team to ensure we have a reliable means of keeping proof of what was said.,1
"Pros:The user interface makes it easy to create a ticket to report trouble or requestsoftware or hardware.There is also a place where knowledge base articles can be added.On the landing page, there is a tile where the company can list any current outages/service interruptions.There is also a full page for System Status where planned maintenance activities can be captured.",1
"I was introduced to Zendesk as part of my onboarding training. Despite multiple functions and features, everything seemed clear and well-thought from the start. I can't imagine handling emails at work without Zendesk. It makes the job much easier and smoother. Absolutely love it.",1
It's a fair experience I can't say that Freshdesk is the best platform however it has a lot of good features includedmoreover the idea of support team is amazing this is what I love the most about freshdesk,1
"It's been a learning experience for us. Overall, I think our service team is stronger as a result of FD, but I also think there is more we could be getting out of FD.",1
Pros:The interface is clean and the software is simple to use: informations are always available in the right place,1

Over all im a very happy employee using Freshdesk as a client support tool. Its ease of functionality and dedicated customer support makes this a worthwhile investment for any business.,1
As I already said. It’s go to software where I can report an issue or get instant help in knowledge base. I have instant notification once ticket is submitted. Fast and easy to navigate user’s interface.,1

Pros:Ease of UseGood DocumentationLots of Resource MaterialIntuitive UIWorks directly with Zoho CRM for added functionality,1

Pros:Zendesk offers a easy-to-use and complete feature set for customer support and external documentation. All of which is maintainable by non-technical people.,1
It helped us reach our customers from single platform.,1
"OVerall we are happy with Freshdesk, esp for the price point, but like most saas softwares they are unbundling things to make more money. Again, we're not against making money in principle but it gets a little tiresome too. We wish the software was a little faster to get to know, but once you do it's pretty easy to use. The customer support has always been helpful, even when we've been frustrated they work with us to solve the problems.",1
Excellent option for those organization that are in the process to implement Customer Support applications with a small budget. With a cloud based deployment can deploy this application quickly saving time and money.,1

Pros:The reliability. In 4 years of using it we've rarely encountered any issues. The integration with other programmes is seamless. The best ticketing system that I've used.,1
"Great, there is no tool i've tried for ticketing that can beat Zendesk at this point. Great features, great marketplace & integrations, very easy to use, so deeply customisable.",1
"Although at first impression this software looked like a solution, I quickly realized it wasn't the right fit for my organization.",0
"I have trialled and evaluated all popular helpdesk apps like Freskdesk, Zayanko, Zendesk, Hiver and others I tested all of them with our actual marketplaces and the actual support email address. Freshdesk is the best overall. Sadly, we don't take up with Freshdesk because of the cost reasons for 2 support users when we need 6 different users. So, we choose another helpdesk for unlimited users and the limited tickets pricing plan.If you ask me which to choose Zendesk or Freshdesk, I would recommend Freshdesk over Zendesk.",1
Can considered Zoho Desk as a reliable customer support software,1
"Pros:JIRA is one of best service desk I have used ever, it enable team to collaborate, Share and assign tasks with each other. I also enables users to have update with email notifications on issues being updated by other users in team",1

An organized support center!,1
Es un software que introdujeron en mi empresa y me encontré con que tiene muchas funciones y tal vez por ignorancia o falta de capacitación no podemos darle el cien por ciento del uso.Generalmente es útil si se tienen a todas las áreas atentas y capacitadas en la gestión de tickets y así conocer el estado de cada uno de esos inconvenientes o soportes que se van generando.,0
Pros:Linking the Jira Service Desk tickets to other internal projects is great for tracking and training.,1
"Overall good value for the money.Like how it integrates with other zoho products.Easy to administer, lots of great features.",1
"Pros:After looking through a hundred or so integrated PPM, Project Management and Ticketing solutions, zoho scored best. They address most of our concerns out of the box.",1
"Pros:Ease of use is first, the customer service can definitely be improved as they prefer more to share article links rather than explaining things. The marketplace has nice apps.The working of help centre is a little complex, particularly language related things.",1
Pros:Jira service desk is used to log and track the issues we are facing during the training preparation.,1
"Pros:The system is easy to use and get up and running. Zendesk support is really out of this world , quick and very helpful. The ticketing system does everything we needed and more, it allowed us to expand our support system because of the added features.",1

"Pros:The richness in features is vast. In demoing a multitude of products, it offered the richest features at the lowest price point.I love the ability to have the knowledge base integrated with chat and ticketing in such a way that clients are prompted with a solution. This reduces inbounds while getting clients the assistance they need faster. I also like the automated workflows that will alert a manager when a case is escalated due to no resolution, being open a certain amount of time as well as other factors.",1
Pros:- Very easy to categorise service requests- Easy to prioritise the service requests- Easy to track and manage service requests- Efficient way to raise and get resolution of the service requests- Great and customizable workflow,1

Pros:Zoho Desk is a great tool that we are using to get requests from our clients. it really helps keep everything organized and clean,1

Nous avons pris un consultant pour nous aider a migrer de l'ancien billetterie vers la JSM. Mais la configuration reste bonne et facile.,1
"For all my frustration with Zendesk, The reporting is great, the guys upstairs will love it. I'm just really unclear why ZD doesn't seem to care about their actual users. I'm guessing the answer is that users don't pay the bills, the people printing the reports do.Some alternatives to consider are Help Scout, UV Desk, or fresh desk, which are all better UI-wise, but have worse reporting... You'll need to pick your poison.",0
"Pros:Integration with Zoho - many of the other chat and ticketing tools don't easily integrate with Zoho, or they only integrate on a limited basis with Zapier.",1
"Pros:It is easy to use, and you can custom your views",1
Overall we are very pleased with Jira Service Management and have implemented incident management processes using it.,1
"Pros:The Freshworks applications are all easily integrated with each other, which makes it easy to set up. The apps in the marketplace make it easy to integrate with most other systems, which is great. I evaluated several products over a week and weekend, standing up different trials for a proof of concept. Freshdesk was the only one that I was able to get started with a minimal amount of configuration. As in, it took me an hour to stand it up, create users, generate test tickets, create responders - almost within an hour. It was insane how much easier it was than the competition. Additionally, the pricing was easy to understand and flexible enough to grow as we grow.",1
"Do you want a tool that does 1000 tasks but all of those tasks are 10% of what you need? GET THIS TOOL.Do you want a tool that has a million different customizations, yet none are what you want and everything is wrongly done? Get it !Sure it's cheap but with all the time you loose, not worth it.BTW, that 24/7 support, yeah, no, does not exist.",0
Overall it was pretty good since the product is so feature/function rich.Getting the support to understand how to best use the product was a challenge sometimes.,1
Pros:The features and the price.I also like the ability to use livechat funtion within the site.We have been pleased.,1
Easy support center vs giving everyone access to one email.Great knowledge base vs running our own custom Knowledge Base.,1
"The WORST company EVER! Because their trial system is so limited I decided to pay for a subscription. COULD NOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME get it up and running properly, then I asked to cancel and have a refund. They continued to ticket my request, then 6mnts later send me a document showing they do no refunds. What a horrible company! I use Agile, a way better system, as is Phoneburner. DO NOT USE ZENDESK",0
"Pros:For ticket raising,grievance, or for technical support, zendesk is lite and best",1
Overall it's an easy to use solution with the exception of reporting.,1
"Zendesk allows us to professional communicate with our customer base, provide a help center of support articles, escalate issues to our engineering team via their Jira integration and improve our customers' experience through Zendesk's reports and analytics.",1
Pros:I enjoy the UI. It's simple and intuitive.,1
"This is an excellent solution that accumulates all our communications in a nice, easily accessible and logical structure.Having used the solution for the past few weeks, I can see all the queries have been placed. I can see a log of all the tasks performed to accommodate the enquiry.From this information we can log the operation to extend our knowledge base. If we ever need to perform a similar task, the knowledge is easily accessible.I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a similar solution. It has excellent functions at an incredible price.",1
"Its a great product for a any IT team to use, the simplicity and ease of use is a major selling point.It comes with additional analytics which you can use to track the performance of the team and individuals.",1
Pros:The speed of this app is really good.It helps in assigning tracking and delivering services to the stakeholders.It is easy to use and very intuitive.The customer support is also very responsive and helps in resolving the issue of any kind.,1
"I have been one of the decision maker in my previous company to decide buying Zoho Desk after our trial period, because of its clean interface and facility to be used to everyone including those without experience in team work organization online.",1
"It has allowed us to handle the communication and follow-up of any technical issue with clients, replacing many times even email and WhatsApp. It is a great benefit for customers and for us too",1
"Por medio de la plataforma hemos logrado dar seguimiento a los PQR's y con ella su solución, ya que permite catalogar prioridades así como los tiempos de vencimientos que se tienen para dar respuesta.",1
"I find OTRS to be deficient in many areas, but most especially in its administrative back end.Its installation and configuration is incredibly arcane; Its LDAP integration is a nightmare; and thedocumentation is more often then not vague, inaccurate, or flat out incorrect.It's upgradability is virtually null.A support contact with OTRS will buy you nothing more than a tech telling you (via email) that you have to pay almost that same amount (per incident) for an onsite technician to decipher code.The only area that OTRS seems to have an advantage is it's ability handle HTML email within the ticket and a good attachmenthandler.However, unless you have a dynamite MySQL DBA, a PERLprogrammer with years of experience, and an MIT educated Linuxadministrator on staff, stay away from OTRS!Don't be seduced by thefantasy of Pay for Support Open Source!Also, don't be strong-armedinto considering purchasing their Cloud Based solutions.There arecheaper and better services out there.",0
It makes it much easier to follow step by step the ordering process and it double as a decent customer database.,1
"Zendesk email, chat make my job a breeze because before I had to wake on another person to get back to me about the lawyer or customer response. Now, it is just me doing all of it myself thanks to this software.",1
"me agrada porque puedo generar correos automatizados, interesar chatbots, asi mismo como tener servicio de telefonia realmente se trabajar de forma muy organizada lo recomiendo realmente",1
"Pros:Service now it is a robust platform that can be customized to your company needs and processes. Can be integrated with others systems you use, and workflow are easily definable for approvals",1
"Tremendous scaling benefits. Adding more users is not just easy, but we have recourse to ensure that our teams can grow at their own paces without worrying if the software can keep up. Zendesk can absolutely keep it; it does not even flinch.",1
"En general la experiencia con Jira es buena, una vez que consigues configurarlo para que se adapte a tus necesidades y gracias a todas las opciones de visualización puedes tener mucha información muy útil para gestionar de forma óptima los proyectos.",1
"I do like Freshdesk,we have been with the tool for a little over 3 years, I have looked for alternatives multiple times, but every time Freshdesk wins and I opt not to switch.",1
"Overall, Freshdesk is generally well-regarded by office workers who use it. Its ease of use, multi-channel support, and customization features make it a popular choice for businesses that need to manage customer inquiries and support requests. However, its limited reporting, integration issues, and cost may be drawbacks for some users.",1
For us it helped making our customer support more agile in responding to tickets. We have improved response time and as we have history on support cases we can track conversations with our customers and give a more tailored response to them.,1
Pros:Permet de tracer tous les bugs/incidents/nouvelles fonctionnalités/tests pour un projetTicket facile à ouvrir et à suivre avec les différents statuts.Echanges fluides via les commentaires sur chaque ticket.Gestion du backlog facilitée également avec priorisation des tâches,1
"FreshDesk is a great ticketing system. We use FreshDesk to support all the schools in our school district.Integration with Google (SSO, profile info, etc) works wonderfully. Knowledge base Articles are great. If we had to do it all over again, we would pick FreshDesk again.Our users love FreshDesk, they often comment how easy it is to place a ticket.",1
"Pros:Zendesk makes it really easy to organize all requests you receive from your in-house team to outside customers. Our team receives hundreds of tickets a week. Since we receive so many tickets, the best features Zendesk has to counter this are Triggers, Automations and Macros. With Triggers, your able to automate activities to happen based on certain criteria. For example, if a ticket gets submitted with the word Help in the subject line, you can program Zendesk to assign it to a specific person and to reply to the submitter with a message. Automations function in a similar way but are timed instead of instantaneous. Macros allow you to update a ticket's tags, message, and other information with a click of a button. Zendesk has done a great job to make a ticketing system that increases company efficiency. It also has a Help Desk (customer forum / QA) section that is available at a specific price tier that could save you time.",1
An easy to use tool for customer service that bringed us a way to prioritization according to the time and difficulty of any case of support.,1
Working with ZenDesk has been great. We've been with them for years and have had a great experience with them.,1
"Keeping track of which clients need the most assistance and the area in which they do,.I would think from an administrators view, a check on employees based on the amount and time put into tickets.",1
Pros:The amount of features to cost over Freskdesk. As well as multi-banding for help centers is nice to have as we have multiple products we support.,1
Efficient tool to manage tickets.,0
Overall experience is very satisfactory. The user interface is very well defined and structured . The pre embedded Customer Satisfaction Survey makes this software even more desirable to have.,1
"Zendesk has been a game changer for my customer support operations. After switching from a different service, I have been able to cut my response time in half, and increase my customer satisfaction by a healthy margin. With the ability to manage multiple support teams, I am able to answer questions, solve problems, and help my customers in a matter of minutes.",1
My overall experience is good. We get to learn new things daily while using a tool like this. Customers also liked the options they had at their hand. Its interactive and easy to use,1

I've been looking for helpdesk solutions for a while now and came across Zoho desk. I had my entire team setup in under two hours without any previous knowledge of the software.The interface is simple and concise.This is going to be a great tool for my team going forward.,1
Can manage the support tickets more efficiently. Also put the tasks in right path.,1
Pros:Great ticket management to help you get started on your business.,1
"In terms of managing the tickets, I have found Fresh desk very reliable, because sometimes one of our agents is working on the tick and if he gets stuck the other agents has the access to desk with that, so no compromise is done on our client’s services. I am very happy with its services.",1
"We used Freshdesk to provide a ticketing system to manage and prioritise the support and product enquiries from our customers. It also provided us with a Customer Portal to allow customers to access a knowledgebase for self-help and to submit/view tickets. Our experience was positive, with good support when we needed it.",1
"Pros:Zendesk makes it easy to receive, track, monitor, and action on tickets / incidents. Data is presented in a clear and logical manner which allows you to focus on closing the ticket instead of manipulating the software.",1
"I have been using Freshdesk to solve various business problems, including improving customer support, increasing efficiency in managing customer tickets, and streamlining communication with customers.Since implementing Freshdesk, I have realized several benefits, such as improved response times to customer inquiries, more efficient ticket management, better collaboration among team members, and increased customer satisfaction. The software's automation and reporting features have also helped us identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to enhance our customer support processes.",1

Pros:Easy to implement. Interface is easily usable by customers who appreciate the model thus giving the possibility of managing the computer park and the assets as well as the contracts.,1
"Pros:Zendesk has always been one of the go-to solutions for helpdesk software, but they've really streamlined their system over the last few years. It's simple and easy to use with straightforward options for even those who are new to using a helpdesk system.Zendesk is basically an email support system, where all emails sent will be routed to your Zendesk dashboard and show up as support tickets. Tickets are tagged with its own ID and even cross-referenced to see if a particular sender has submitted any tickets prior, so it's easy to check through the support history. There are also pre-defined responses, allowing for quick and easy replies for typical queries.Of course, these are actually what you might believe every helpdesk system should provide, but you'll be surprised at how much you have to pay and that some don't even have these options at all. Zendesk is actually very affordable and is easily scalable.",1
Pros:Easy startup and straightforward way to use the normal procedures. A good way of making simple procedures and to assign tasks automatically.,1
"Pros:Zoho is priced accordingly, it's not too expensive and it does have a variety of other/supporting services to compliment the full all one system.",0
"Pros:Ultimately, Intercom connects the dots between the customer experience and our products. That lets us learn and innovate much faster.",1
Pros:The fact that OTRS is open source and free was a big draw. It was not terribly difficult to configure.,0
"Pros:Great flow management with the status of the taks, division by Epics very useful and categories like bug, task, and so on.",1
"A very reliable and trustworthy dashboard and with cloud support, we can access it from anywhere.",1
The overall experience was excellent and the onboarding was smooth. I can definitely recommend this app to products that need regular customer support for their apps.,1
Centralizing the information my team uses in our enviornemnt and your software. keeping track of and reporting on events and sales activities(we've been using CRM from ZOHO for many years),1
I would say Zendesk is a great tool for handling communications with customers from all over the world. It enables your team to take ownership of the messaging and streamlines the emailing process.,1
"It works, it is affordable, I wouldn't recommend it when compared to other tools out there.",0
We use service now every time a change request needs to be raised our experience has been fine but the UI is very bad.,0
"Pros:This great looking app just makes my work so easy. Easy in every way as it allows me to always be in touch with the clients almost in real time. I love the fact that is so easy to create, ask, share and report work tickets. For me, this has been the greatest costumer service software I've used. To be able to also enter my coworkers tickets and take a look at their work and the way they respond has helped me improve a lot. I can also merge tickets, send emails, listen to voice phone messages... You name it. Works great and makes my work so easy to do and improve. Love this app.",1
"For me it very good, specially the change.very easy to create change and follow up with the different parties.",1
We use zendesk for customer support ticketing mostly related to support but also for potential sales,1
Pros:The best thing I feel about Zoho is its user-friendly interface for ticketing systems. We can easily categorize the tickets by tagging them as required. Implementation and setup were also very smooth and fast—excellent customer service from Zoho.,1

Before implementing more of Zendesk in my day, I would get messages from my managers and other team members from chats or emails. I felt overwhelmed with keeping track with who said what and if I actually completed the task at hand. When I switched, I had my team reach out to a support email we had connected to Zendesk, which helped me get a grasp to claim ownership and see all of the completed the tasks asked to be done. I saw patterns of requests, so I took more moments to teach others how to fix the problem, if possible to allow more time for other projects.My company also uses this platform for our customer service team. I like to see we can have both IT and customer service on one platform, while also knowing there can be more expansion to other departments in the office space. Each group can see ticket request come in, if they're still open or pending, and if closed out.There support team is great and they have a great knowledge base full of helpful tips and answers to any questions you might have.",1

"JIRA Service Desk is one of those pieces of software. One of the ones that you can only describe as awesome. It tied into our JIRA installation easily in a few clicks and within a few hours we had a fully working Service Desk system for our customers.The User Interface is clean and friendly - it guides the user through the process of filing their issue without the intimidating wall of text.Two things I disliked:- The first was that you can't have two issue fields of the same type. This was an annoying issue - whether it was operator error or a feature not in JIRA Service Desk, I don't know.- The Support Portal - more customisation options would have been great. It's nice to have your logo there, but having your colour scheme match up like JIRA and Confluence would also be a nice-to-have.Our issue with our previous methods was that we were still on email. It was difficult to locate tasks and often our email server would break down. JIRA Service Desk solved these issues and allowed us to get clear and concise information from our users. We liked the fact that none of us had to see the usual PLEASE HELP, COME IMMEDIATELY!!! emails, but instead be able to get an early diagnosis of the issue and it's underlying roots. We improved our issue resolution time significantly.Atlassian is an amazing company, they support their users very well and answer questions very quickly. Give JIRA Service Desk a try, it's worth the time.",1

Pros:This review is specifically for their Zendesk Livechat program. We've used it for years. We switched live chat programs once to Intercom and ended up switching back. The program is easy to implement and it just works. If you are looking for a live chat option highly recommend this. We have used their help desk ticketing software as well which is great.,1
"For our company our customers are the most precious asset, and their satisfaction is an extremely important aspect for us in which we work daily to maintain and even increase it as much as possible, we implement new techniques to favor customer relationships and generate trust and an overall exceptional experience while they are using our services, It is here where Zoho Desk takes the place and plays an important role because thanks to its implementation, we managed to improve response times to their requests, customer service agents can view and manage tickets more efficiently and easily, which has allowed us to respond to their queries quickly and effectively; This has undoubtedly led to a significant increase of approximately 40% in their satisfaction, we have really benefited from the use of Zohk Desk.",1

LOVE the Knowledge Base and Customer Portal (though I prefer the community on Zoho Connect and also LOOOVEE their Manuals (their version of a knowledge base) and wish there was more direct integration features available for use between Zoho Desk and Zoho COnnect though I think by providing a link on my Desk portal I've hopefully accomplished it enough",1
Jira is a complete solution for tracking an historic even and related events as the tickets and sub tickets are linked under one roof.,1
Pros:It allows to establish fluid communication with the client by interconnecting all the necessary departments of the company. The subsequent follow-up that can be given to you is very usable,1
Pros:I like how easy it is for customers to ping for assistance and to be able to help them as soon as they inquire,1

"I've used Zendesk in all of the ventures I've participated in. Unfortunately. I get it that in 2012 it was an easy option, but today there are plenty more and plenty of options of building out solutions yourself if customer support means everything to you.",0
"Pros:The integration between their tools is awesome. Obviously JIRA Service Desk uses JIRA in the back, which gives you all the powers of a regular JIRA project.But that's not all! You can link your JIRA (Service Desk) with Confluence (knowledge base), HipChat (quick and easy communication via chat), and much more.",1
We get a fairly inexpensive platform that allows us to handle basic customer service needs. It also brings us some much needed organization to emails that we could not find anywhere else.,0

"My advice to people generally is if you’re implementing a new system like this, especially in a grid of technology, please please please hire someone who is versed. Pay the money for the set up. Pay the money for someone who can educate someone else in your company",1
"Overall, Zendesk has made the experience wonderful! Despite getting used to the ticketing order, Zendesk offers navigable system that any company should ought to try!",1
"IT was not prioritizing, tracking, resolving and following through on all the support calls it was getting resulting in staff displeasure. IT has significantly improved in those areas and staff satisfaction has gone up.",1

Easier issue tracking and no lost tickets. We used to have a hard time keeping track of issues in our support email and which user was taking care of it.,1
"Pros:I've worked with Freshdesk in two contexts before: as technical support and as a CSM. During my times as tech support, I've used Freshdesk daily, replying to tickets. The software is easy to use, and you can learn it in a day or two. I really like that you can have a lot of customized fields, which can be integrated with other software (for example Hubspot). This allows you to have a lot of information about the person who's writing to you.",1
"Pros:The flexibility, all the things you can setup for a project to be tracked here, the board management, workflows, assignments, roles and that fits so great for Scrum teams.",1
"This platform is the best complete and versatile solution that allows any company to efficiently manage its customer service in the simplest and most comfortable way possible. Although it has some disadvantages and can be expensive for some businesses, the benefits it offers, such as centralizing customer communication and automating tasks, make it a valuable tool for improving the customer experience. Using this tool with adequate training and a solid strategy offers exceptional customer service, which makes a difference in the satisfaction and loyalty of each customer.",1
"Overall, JIRA is a simple to use and configure. It's easily manage all the client project, Task and bug reports in jira management tool. It's easily manager all the IT related assets and complain ticket. We can set the SLA alert and configure the notification from email.",1
"It's been fantastic. The support team is very helpful in setting up the program, and they don't slack off once you're on board, like some companies do. They are very attentive, and seem to be interested in helping you solve your problems in a quick and efficient manner.",1
"Pros:The ease of use, smoothness of operation, ability for customers to login to their own portal, ability to set different ticket types, snippets, and forwarding emails as tickets",1
"We are extremely happy with Zoho Desk, so our customers. Our customer make fault tickets 24x7 and we can respond every tickets as per SLA. We also use Zoho Assist which is integrated with Desk. As a result, whenever remote support session is needed, that can be done withing the tickets. Our customer like this most. Everything is possible for Zoho Desk.",1
Pros:Zendesk enables our small company to offer a professional level of support,1
"Service Desk was there 20 days after taking a buying choice and it was great in every level. The team of operators only required 30 minutes of training and they are very happy with the tool.After 8 months of working we are controlling 2000 tickets/month without troubles, and with a long way ahead of sla, mail handling and knowledge sharing projects.",1
"My overall experience with freshdesk is that I am, frustrated with the level of service and the flexibility of the product.",0
Pros:It's so helpful with keeping our team organized and making sure that work is delegated equally and attended to.,1
Pros:I have been avid ITIL practitioner and have been using various products in various companies of my job experience. ServiceNow supports ITIL processes completely and most efficiently where there are minor drawbacks. The level of compromise required to enable processes efficiently is less as compared to Remedy and HPSM. Service Now has harnessed the power of virtual assistants which is yet being explored by other companies. The ease of set-up and manageability makes configuration of ServiceNow a cake-walk.,1
"I have en evaluating Zoho Desk - I'm a longtime user of Teamwork Desk, so my experience is weighed against that platform. I have been pleasantly surprised by a few things in Zoho Desk up to now - customer assignment from forwarded email tickets works very well. I like the ability to make light agents which essentially is a free user account for staff that might need to be consulted on an issue. Lowers the overall number or user licenses. I'd love to be able to integrate CRM data, but we don't use ZOHO CRM, so that will take custom coding. I wish there was integration with Zoho Projects, which seems to make sense. I don't use this product to support software development, or physical product support. Zoho Desk is fully featured to support those things, and that makes setup a little complex - there's a pretty high configuration learning curve and the documentation is not terribly clear in all instances. Phone/email/chat support however, has been EXCELLENT. I realize not all have had the same experience, YMMV, as they say. One more positive comment - the ability to quickly visualize particular agents queues, move things around using the various views, and the threaded way of displaying the ticket activity chain is quite nice. So far, I think the transition to Zoho will be a positive thing. It's definitely work a look.",1
Pros:Zendesk has a very user friendly platform. There are a lot of different customization options as well making it more desirable than salesforce. The latest ticket features are extremely helpful for our business. Plus they are easy to read and utilize. They have a lot of great apps and they have great team support. The price is also very reasonable for what they offer.,1
"Pros:Esta herramienta me parecio muy intuitiva y facil de implementar para las areas que se desee, acelerando el flujo de trabajo.",1
Pros:Zendesk eliminates the needs for emails and easy to filter messages.Integrate with Salesforce and many other applications.Provide powerful reporting and customer satisfaction surveys.,1
We are tracking all our IT issues. The users are sending an email to freshservice and a ticket is immediately opened. The ticket then is assigned to the correct team based on the subject of the email.,1
"With the countless hours chasing tickets and maintenance's there is a new way to manage tickets. As a service provider and network engineer when it came time to determine what system to use for tracking customer support issues I knew there were a lot of choices.I looked into ticketing systems I have used in the past that require a lot of support and local maintenance and found a few light weight systems that I could install. I searched for ticketing systems and found a list that included Zendesk. Curious about the name I went to the website and in two clicks was signed up, set up, and ready to take tickets. Testing the system and running with “test” tickets, before I knew it I had set up my entire system for two ticketing systems and was ready for taking calls.My customers were going to be updated via emails directly and I received notices 24/7 of any tickets created.This fulfilled all of my current needs but I was looking for a robust option for the future when the business takes off and I have a few more agents working with me, or a hundred.This system has already proven that it can grow with my needs as I have just upgraded my services. We are more than satisfied with Zendesk and it support and training as well as its social media links, which helps us stay connected to our customers.",1
"Zendesk seems to be a great customer service tool, but I wouldlike it to be able to allow workers receiving emails/tickets to forward them for inspection when there is a question about their legitimacy.",1
"Overall functionality very good, i would definitely recommend it if your company is facing customer daily & need to reply all the inquiries in a transparent manner",1
"Definitely a learning curve when getting set-up, but it becomes pretty powerful once you learn the functionality available.",1
"Overall, we are very happy with our Freshdesk experience. Using alternative software previously, (Jira Support Desk), we found the helpdesk experience enriched, easier for the customer and staff, and overall provides us the ability to support our clients faster and more efficiently than we have ever done before.",1
"Pros:This is a good product for managing all types of help desks, including customer relationships, etc.It is all cloud based.",1
Pros:Features and functions to manage tasks and sub-tasks,1
"Overall, it is a good starter product and is helpful but a lot of tweaking is needed and the product offering is geared to pull you towards needing the Pro package. One day I may choose that but wish I could have a vanity URL for email now with a one time fee.",1
Pros:I have really enjoyed working with Zendesk. I find the ability and available options for customization and organization are a refreshing change. I have been surprised at the amount of help resources available for self help and found the company reps to be knowledgeable and quick to respond to my query's. Overall it has been a very positive experience.,1
Very impressed.,1
Overall experience has been good. Very happy for the product and how it helps us stay organized with the tickets we have coming in.,1
Pros:Ease of use with remote working was a critical requirement.Ability to have telephony and CRM integrated under one platform in a cost effective solution.,1
"Pros:1. Amazing, intuitive and easy to use interface2. Role level view of the dashboard3. Ticket view where you can see all the tickets at once4. Cost is relatively less(not much) than other softwares",1
Pros:Thecompany with deal with where we deal with via Zendesk is very attentive and the software allows us to maintain an almost real time communication center.,1
"After considering multiple options, we decided to go with Freshdesk because it provided the optimal balance of features, cost, and user-friendliness for our company. Freshdesk's range of tailored features includes ticket management, scheduling, lead and sales pipeline management, knowledge base management, project and task management, contact database and support ticket management, content management, service history, and contact management, in addition to its customizable library of options that can be tailored to suit our specific business requirements.",1
Pros:Lo fácil y sencillo que es reportar un problema y hacer seguimiento de este. Las rapidez en las notificaciones cuando la otra parte contesta. Y la sencillez del estado de los tickets.También destacaría lo eficaz que resulta el poder hacer una búsqueda en los listados y ver posibles incidentes similares al que se esta reportando.,1
"If I could go back in time, with the information I have now, I would select Zendesk. That is software written by and for adults.I would also say: the support provided by Freshdesk is eager and well-meaning, however the quality has been very poor. The support team will generally ignore obvious bugs in the software and waste time with a series of questions. Core bugs go months and months without correction. Escalations to management are ignored. The CSM team makes big promises and then vanishes for weeks or months at a time, without so much as email response. Generally, it is a very poor showing.",0
"Fast return on investment, better service to our clients. Very good things.",1
Pros:The most important thing it's to have all channels just with one platform and can make tracking to my support service.,1
"Overall, Jira has made our lives more manageable in terms of tickets/issues/projects management.",1
Pros:Compared to other help desk software it is good for the price. It allows agents to customize how they want to view tickets/dashboard. It has a very modern looking color scheme and layout.,0
"Freshdesk helped BootUp LLC to get on top of their user help desk support problems, and this NYC-based MSP is now poised to grow its client base by hiring more technical staff and expanding its support offerings. Our collective experience with Freshdesk has been extremely positive, and we recommend it wholeheartedly!",1
"Good enough, there are better more expensive alternatives",0
"Pros:The ticketing mechanism is good and the suggestive feature of the knowledge base works quite well. The initial setup is a bit tricky but for the users of the organisation, it is good.",1
The support desk platform is simple to use and offers a ton of useful features. Customer support is also excellent. They always answer quickly.,1
Great experience,1
Adopting Freshdesk for the IT Services dept has given us a place to communicate effectively with users and also track our own internal workflow. The additional benefit has been the adoption of freshdesk by several other teams in our enterprise following the success of it in our IT Services Dept. They liked how the workflow streamlined communications and centralized jobs.,1
Pros:It's easy to add screenshots and links to any issue so we can report with as much detail as possible. Search makes it easy to find issues as well.,1
"Pros:Solid integration with other Zoho apps, specifically the two-way sync with the CRM. We started using it as a tool for our help desk, but then started migrating our sales emails and calls thorough it to unify those communications, eliminate emails and have the ability track these interactions better.",1
1. Quick resolution of any query on time.2. assigning a particular key area ticket to the specific agent or people.3. Automation option which sends auto mail on any updates on tickets.4. Generation tickets through the email option. 5. The whole conversation of any query is same mail and have a unique ticket no.6. Make easy to answer on a phone call regarding the status of tickets.7. Customers can also see the status itself.8. Knowledgebase features with lost of folders type structure.,1
"We use it for getting tickets from our customers and internal employee ranging from bugs, vacation request, improvement, order coffe and legal advice! Very flexible.We use also it attached to a strong asset management add-on",1
"Freshdesk is a resourceful application that increases the customer help, and rational engagement. The platform focuses on the CRM, which is professional in enhancing better relationship with clients.",1
Pros:It would be hard to find another ticketing system that is as robust as Zendesk. It can pretty much do anything that any other system can do.,1
"I've had a good experience as their default options meet our requirements; however, to make the software more beneficial for us and more personalized, we've had to jump through loops and hoops with sometimes not getting a resolution from their side as to what we wish to do in their system.",1
"My former employer used Zen Desk for sales order automation support. We had previously used a system that was designed in-house, but it was cumbersome and unstable. When we switched to Zen Desk, we were surprised at how easy it became to create and track support tickets, and we didn't have to worry about frequent system errors.",1
The system allows our business to have a 24/7/365 helpdesk with searchable answers as well as the ability to open support tickets for those who still have questions.,1
"Pros:I like the capability to connect with CRm systems, it allows me to connect with my clients in realtime and escalate the situation when is needed",1
"Pros:Modern and easy to use interface, can be administered and customized without any specific knowledgeHas all the basic functions support software should haveNice workflow/escalation rules to automate support proceduresGood intergation capabilities (phone calls, chats, Zoho CRM)",1
"Overall, it is a great piece of software.Scalable and easy to use. Still can improve on a few things.",0
"We love our helpdesk, and I would recommend Zendesk to anyone looking for a better way of interacting with your customers and providing enterprise-level support away from e-mail.When the cons above are developed and updated (which I imagine they will be), we will have an extremely robust solution.I can honestly attribute Zendesk to the tool that positively changed our interactions with customers.Using e-mail, managers struggle to know or understand clients' needs and how effective support is.And employees struggle with inbox overload and lost issues that don't get prioritized or addressed timely.Zendesk improved our response times dramatically, provides insights into the type of issues and questions our clients ask about, and keeps us accountable to our customers' feedback through integrated client surveys after tickets are solved.",1
"Overall Zoho Desk has been a great fit for us, we also use zoho books and zoho subscriptions.It fits nicely into our suite of products that we are using.",1
We use Zendesk to help resolve customer requests and so far it has been working great.,1
Brings centralization and customer inquiries management. Offers automation and great customer support.,1
ease of use and availability for small organisation,1
"Very smooth, easy to set-up, understand, and train my team.",1
Pros:We were looking for a good help desk software and Zoho covered all of our necesities.,1
Would use other products within ZOHO as needed.,1
Pros:Easy to start with a basic free setup and upgrade as your company grows or develops the need for more features.,1
"An easy way to interact with customers and respond to contacts from them across a wide variety of platforms like email, Facebook, and Twitter.",1
I was introduced to Jira Service Desk when I started working at my first job. It has an awesome and simple workflow and helps with keeping things organized and tracked. Everyone in the company picked it up pretty easily and my team of IT supports are enjoying it as well.,1
"we have used this software form many years, and it has a great help in the managing and solving of tickets from any issues with the users.",1
Support System,1
"Happy to use it. Overall, it is better experience than Zendesk, easier than SalseForce and more track-optional than Gmail (or any mail platform).",1
Pros:La chiarezza grafica e l’ordinazione dei ticket in modo facile da gestire tra noi colleghi,1
"We spent months looking at alternative support and knowledgebase options. From self-hosted to SaaS, Freshdesk offered what we need to support our customers at a price we can afford. While we haven't utilized other products in the FreshWorks suite, we're very happy with Freshdesk and recommend it wholeheartedly.",1
It is an excellent system tickets with very good follow up process.,1
"Experience is good, but reporting is a must feature across all plans ranging from basic to premium.",1
"Pros:At first it seems like you are almost getting nothing for that price, but you are getting automation, efficiency, and almost zero confusion between team members and clients.",1
We have had ZenDesk for almost 4 years now. The value is good for what you pay for but they continue to make very bad changes without telling you. Functionality disappears and they have always lacked some key metrics for reporting.,0
"We were able to distribute queries in an agile way to the different material units by objective, just as we used quick reactions to respond to visitors in an agile way. Overall, Freshdesk is a great app for processing customer management and query results.",1
A very affordable solution for a small company.,1
Great experience till date,1
"Overall, I really enjoy this software. It is well trusted, easy to use, and provides a good experience",1
"was facing too much service issue, but now everything is under control and on track.",1
It’s changed our service desk and the level of service we now provide to our end customers. Quite simply once this is setup correctly it will transform your customer experience…,1
Pros:The software can be extended to many use cases. So you can future proof the solution with a view to add more modules to be integrated among those modules.,1
Tres belle experiencesmerci,1
Pros:Using the automation setups we never forget clients (tickets reopen after x days depending on their Priority)Passing a client onto another go worker is one click awayThe private notes between emails with clients is a life & time saver,1
"Actualmente tenemos implementado este programa tanto para la gestion interna del departamento de IT como con clientes que requierens de un servicio postventa,",1
"I have been using Zoho Desk for a while and it's a game changer. Easy to use and with amazing support.Once you get used to it, you will love it.Using Desk changed our company for good since we can have in one place, the way we interact with our customers and vendors.",1

"Primarily Helpdesk, although also sales and general phone enquiries.",1
Pros:The option available with Zoho to sync with WhatsApp like a chat application is a brilliant idea. I liked that functionality a lot.,1

It’s great overall. We are a company of 125k + employees and it’s a handy tool to have.,1
"Pros:The configuration is easy and most flexible concerning workflows, screens, fields and so on. There are many add-ons available in marketplace to enhance it's functionality.",1
from my own experience I recommend freshdesk due to its easy to use,1
Pros:- ticket management- SLAs and routing support is great- hierarchical and granular access controls,1
Pros:Software is easy to use. Ability to customize workflow of tickets as well as input forms is helpful.,1
I use this product everyday for my domain based e-mail accounts. I really like it; i've never had a problem setting it up and receiving e-mails and sending e-mails.,1
My customers started getting more confidence that they will surely get a response from us. Auto notification email helps us to examine the issue in detail and get back to customers with definite solutions. The portal and knowledgeable is really helpful and this reduces the number of support tickets. Only concern is that the interface should be little more responsive as well email block and white list is required is some customers does not prefer to get the notification emails.,1
Pros:Provides key customer information so agents can provide personal support.,1
Pros:The built-in remote supportmake us ditch teamviewer which overcomes the limitation of 5 minutes per session.,0

"Pros:The software is very easy to use, doesn't require training for the team.",0
It's an upgrade over our previous tool.The features it provides allow us to have better control of the emails and the response time to our customers.,1
We are an MSP who works completely off this solution and it has changed our workflow tremendously.The new release has some added features such as scheduling/reminders that has helped us hit the tickets that are time sensitive more efficiently.The customization for rules are very useful and has allowed us to create a workflow that limits manual work.,1
"Pros:How easy it is to open tickets by sending an email. Once the ticket is open, I can easily assign it to the correct agent.",1

"Pros:Email management, this was the whole reason the company I work for got Zoho desk. We have been using just a normal email provider and it made it hard for us to maintain accountability if a colleague did not sign the email with their name. Zoho desk made it easy to make sure the workload was evenly assigned and provided us with the ability to maintain accountability when errors were made with customer responses. When new emails came in it would assign it to whoever was working emails for that time being, if the person who got assigned the emails wasn't able to respond with or know the answer to the question the customer was asking it would be easy for them to reassign the emails to somebody else that would be able to respond correctly. The integration of Zoho desk was easy it didn't take us long to get the hang of it.",1
Great overall product and experience.5 stars. Highly recommended!,1
"Pros:I love the fact that the flow is very nice. All options and functions are working as intended and are very easy to find, no need to lose time in settings.",1
Pros:We used Zoho Desk when starting out when we needed a way to manage customer support outside of email. Zoho Desk is a basic customer support software - great that there is a free version for starting out.,1

We've been using it for years and every time we wandered off (people turnover, plans/functionality changes etc) we saw a sharp decrease in the quality of customer service.",1
My favourite tool for really big software projects.,1
Customer support has been great. But I definitely find myself submitting more tickets and asking more questions than I think should be necessary.,1

"My general experience has been perfect, it makes my work exceptionally simple with regards to giving client support and approach client information to all the more likely help. I enthusiastically suggest!All in all, Zendesk Suite is a useful asset for overseeing client care tasks. Its broad highlights, including call logging, call directing, continuous endlessly talk records, make it a thorough answer for smoothing out client collaborations.

I assisted with implementation in the department and creating knowledge base answers. The overall installment and training was straight forward and easy.,1
"Pros:I am a I.T jack of multi trades for my company. One of those roles is the sole contact for Internal technical support. I came across Freshdesk 3 years ago and have loved it ever since.My favorite feature of Freshdesk initially was the customization options for tickets. It allowed me to tailor the ticket template to exactly what worked for me. I was also able to adjust the remainder of the admin settings to make Freshdesk work exactly how I needed it to for how I logged tickets with my organization.Freshdesk also has several great features that I don't use personally but I think would be very beneficial to larger teams , etc.I looked at several leading solutions before deciding on Freshdesk but they required me to follow a mandatory process / workflow or their customization options were limited.Freshdesk surprised me with all it was packed with.I haven't had to contact Freshdesk support on many occasions over the past 3 years but they were always fast and friendly when I did require some help.",1

The integrations with other productivity software and the willingness of their team to work with you to customize (to a degree) the HelpDesk platform to fit your specific needs is pretty good.",1
"Pros:We were able to use it without paying at the beginning and it solved multiple problematics we had ( ticketing, live chat, knowledge sharing )",1

I hate Jira and think the only reason everyone uses it is that they're just used to suffer.Here's an article about it:[SENSITIVE CONTENT],0
Pros:Easy to use. We trained our offshore team in under 1 hour. The dashboards give a great view of our first response time and single contact resolutions.,1
"I actually do not love service desk at all. Yeah it's great for creating simple end user tickets. But the lack of:- users being unable able to edit tickets (unless its a comment)- can't skin it the way I want- help center can't be skinned at all- it's ugly- the SLA's suck (maybe I just don't understand them)For the money I paid, and for what I have i feel its grossly over priced.Oh yeah and the fact that I was reached out to by 3 members of atlassian to find out why I didn't like and then when I sent my replies no one ever reached back out.It blows straight and simple.",0
"We've been using Freshdesk for 2 years and have built a great knowledge base of information for our customers.We have more and more people utilizing it and solving their own problems.Any time I've contacted Freshworks support, they've replied in a timely manner and resolved my issue quickly.I'm very glad we decided on Freshdesk over the other support tools we evaluated!",1
So far its been great! I have no complaints with this yet,1
"I love how easy it is to extract the reports, the function it has, the many integrations we can make. It also offers chat support. The platform is easy to use and there are many options for customer service. The numerous integrations that exist facilitate the work with the other products that a company has.",1

I think it's a great product.,1
I like using it and it has its own cloud based backup and progress is never lost and I know my hospital coworkers love it,1
"Overall our experience with Zendesk is good, the system does what it needs to do. I do feel like there are not many changes coming into effect, while there are many things still to be developed. For example sending new tickets to clients look like they get a response on an open ticket, which doesn't make much sense. This has been reported many times over the years, but the issue remains.",0
Absolutely good. We're using it ever day and there's almost nothing to complain about.Additionally we receive a very low amount of tickets regarding issues with Freshdesk from our customers.,1

"The use of the software has improved the customer service time, in addition there are records and reports of the most common failures to improve the strategies. It also has a history of all tickets attended to solve major problems. The best thing is that they are updating the platform to incorporate new attention functions.",1
"convenient, readily accessible.",1
Had to work on performance and having the team to speed up replies to the customer. Very good.,1
This tool/crm is very easy to utilise without any instruction.,1
"We were having a hard time managing customer service and support because customers could contact us through multiple channels and we didn't see how they were interacting with us. We were able to address these issues and streamline our customer support processes with the assistance of Zoho Desk.The capacity of Zoho Desk to incorporate multiple customer service channels into a single platform is one of its primary advantages. We can manage support tickets, phone calls, emails, messages on social media, and more with Zoho Desk.

We can use analytics and reporting tools to gain insight into our customer support performance, automate routine tasks, and create custom workflows.In general, Zoho Desk has assisted us in raising customer satisfaction, strengthening our relationships with them, and raising the standard of our customer support and service.",1

Great product; sets the industry standard.,1

Their customer service was really poor. They had a £600 recurring subscription enabled on sign up and would not even entertain cancelling this down when we were a day into the recurring payment. All their answers seem quite scripted and unhelpful (unless it's on the script!),1
Very nice tool thats easy to use and simplifies it for my team on scheduling and callbacks to the customers that require help.Great ticketing software for IT.,1
Soddisfacente,1
"We never had support on issues, lost clients, lost statistics, etc.But when payment is due, then they sent many emails. When we say we did not renew because the lack of support, they (very late) answer was non polite.Bad experience.",0
"Lo recomiendo ampliamente, ya que Freshdesk es una herramienta de fácil uso, que nos ayuda a llevar un mayor control de las gestiones",1
We are using Zendesk for all support and it has been great.Our customers view us as a big company and we are a small company.We love Zendesk talk as it has saved us from implementing a phone system.,1

Pros:Pretty much everything to do with ticket management and notifications from our internal 'customers',1
"Overall, Zendesk allowed us to create a new ticketing platform and process for the business. Its integration with Slack drove great user adoption and encouraged submissions. This platform allowed us to report on the most common IT and biz ops issues at our org while allowing agents to service and help the team effectively. It's pretty ideal that you can manage your workload, triage requests, and reply to folks all in a few clicks. It's really all-in-one if you integrate with your CRM too.",1

Also, the reporting features available offer alot of flexibility to create reports that are helpful for your business and goals in Customer Support. I chatted on Zendesk daily and love the way it handles live chat support for Agents.",1
Pros:Managing chats of customer support and team made easy with automations and worflows. It makes support data look easy to understand on dashboard.,1
"I have had a great experience with Freshdesk. It is a comprehensive customer service and help desk solution that helps businesses improve customer satisfaction, reduce customer support costs, and increase overall efficiency. The user interface is intuitive and easy to use, plus it has features specifically designed for customer service agents such as automated ticket assignment rules, canned responses, multi-channel communication options (including email and chat), reporting tools to track response time and performance metrics. Additionally, the platform offers integrated solutions that can be customized according to specific business needs such as integrating with popular CRMs like Salesforce or Zendesk. The most important feature of Freshdesk that I found appealing was the ability to manage multiple accounts from one centralized location.",1
Excellent support system for teams or any project!,1
I enjoy zen desk a lot and it really simplifies my tasks and makes everything easier to tea k,1
Facilita el orden y la atención al cliente,1
Jira is a wonderful project management tool that has allowed us to interact directly with clients and collaborators who can see the progress of the project for themselves.,1
"Jira excels in defect management with its robust issue tracking, collaborative workflows, advanced search capabilities, extensive integration options, and customizable features, making it a powerful tool for efficiently tracking, resolving, and analyzing defects throughout the software development lifecycle.",1
Pros:Features that can be easily adapted to your needs.,1
"You'd think that 400M of total investments gets you an insanely good piece of software. It does not.Freshdesk was a huge step up from the tool we used previously and has some nice features. It's disappointing that some of the features are lackluster implemented or missing altogether or require you to purchase a higher tier license - just to maybe get one more feature out of a whole bundle you won't need.That's not a stand-alone issue in this industry, but it's extra disappointing if you come across a promising tool that just can't go that extra mile.",1
"Pros:This is fantastic CRM tool for little size companies, it enables us to keep worldwide inquires efficient in a prompt way. We have the ability to minimize the spam and to improve our procedures",1
"Overall, our experience with Zendesk as a support ticketing system has been good. While a bit expensive for the amount of features we use, the integrations and automations available work well with our current client workflow and processes.",1

Pros:Great customer support solution where you can address customer's inquiry and concerns real time. Using this through chat allows us to serve our clients 24 x 7. Everything is documented and stored for future purposes. Sending of files through chat is easy. I have not experienced major difficulty or error. Everything works fine and our clients are satisfied and we are having less complaints or delays.,1
I am globally satisfied with this solution evec if the price is a little bit expensive,1
JIRA Service Desk helped us create a marketing service desk in just 2 months.We can now create campaigns and marketing reports in record time freeing us up to do more projects.,1
Muy buena experiencia.,1
Generally very good.,1
Pros:Zoho is a great product for a new business thats just getting started on a cost standpoint. Great products and awesome service,1
"Overall, I think this is a great help desk software for smaller businesses or start-ups.It’s easy to implement and get started using the help desk features.There is a 21 day trial so you have time to see if it will work for your company and whether you will need to pay for more features you need or not.Even with paying for more features, the price point is lower than most of the help desk software I’ve tried out.",1
Pros:The ease of operations as it moves the tickets. Seems to meet our needs. We like its integration with ZOHO CRM.,1
My business processes are simplified ad streamlined into ine channel,1
We keep track of the requests made by clients by Freshdesk and consistently work on the tickets issued. The responses provided by us are very quick and it satisfies them. We keep checking for any new requirements made by clients and this way we keep time bound for the solutions. Freshdesk makes the communication very smooth.,1
"Pros:I like the usability most about Freshdesk. Once you understand the buttons, navigating the software is seamless and moderating your team is easy. The export functions serve as a mass database and report generator all while having the ability to track corresponding infomation throughout the system.",1
"Pros:Zendesk does service desk really well in terms of the basic functionalities like ticket management, triaging, tracking, and routing. Zendesk also offers add-ons for sales CRM, live chat support, and other apps that a SMB might need as it scales its operations and teams. Integrations with other platforms like CRM, Marketing Automation, customer data platforms, and messaging platforms such as Slack are relatively turnkey and require little involvement from developers.",1
"The best cloud-based customer service software, Zendesk, was created with customer service representatives in mind. Any channel, including text SMS, the web, a mobile app, the phone, email, and social media, can be used to quickly resolve issues and track customer complaints. Your support staff has access to all client interactions, including those tracked through 700+ app integrations, thanks to AI-powered processes. Learn how Zendesk helps businesses like Uber, Venmo, Shopify, and LendingClub reduce support expenses and improve customer happiness.",1
Easy to use and in the organisation I'm currently working in it has been well developed with end users in mind,1
Overall I believe Zendesk was instrumental in providing fast and high level of email-based customer service.,1
"Pros:Good customer service, were prompt to respond when I encountered an issue linking telephone provider.Seems to have a good amount of features for the price.I like that there is no cap on the number of contacts added, as some other programs seem to have.Price is very reasonable for a small business, and when I asked to give the trial another go after trying out some other programs, they were very accomodating.",1
ZenDesk provides the needed capability of tracking requests/problems among several different teams. Highly recommended.,1
"The overall experience has been good.Once we started using it, there is no need to explore any other tool. Solves our purpose completely",1
"Overall, Freshdesk is a powerful tool that can help businesses manage their customer support processes more effectively, improve customer satisfaction, and increase productivity.",1
"Pros:Service now makes integrating workflow automation easy. I am able to carry out multiple IT Service management activities, ranging from incident management to Change management. it helps to aid accountability, you are able to view the work effort of each employee and the time it takes for incidents to be resolved in line with SLA. With Service now, I am able to view all task and incidents raised to my team at every particular point in time, assign them to appropriate team for resolution and also follow up on resolution. It also provides a platform where i am able to identify trends and recurring issues.The dashboard allows me to view all related activities at a glance, for me it is the best ITSM tool .",1
"Very good experience since several years, with 10 agents now and more than 10k tickets solved",1
"Zendesk chat made my job so easy and smooth, I love how all my extensions worked with it (Grammarly, Text Expander) and it was helpful regarding alerting you on time and when the customer reads the chat and when they are typing.",1
The Zoho desk is very versatile and simple to set up. You get a great helpdesk system for any small- to medium-sized organisation for the price.,1
"Pros:What I like the most is the price structure. You really get a lot of value comparing to the other big helpdesk software platforms.Also the easy integratiosn with other Zoho applications is a huge advantage.It's a very mature pease of software, it really helped to streamline the support in my company.",1
A great Support solution for our global support organisation with deep integrations with our CRM.,1
It is so much more streamlined than our old software SDP and I use this product nonstop for all of our customer supportneeds and will be adding the phone feature very soon.,1
Good,1
Pros:The ability to setup up multiple channels direct for specific clients. The call routing of DDI’s and reporting is important to monitor KPI’s.There are lots of great features such as automations which is great when you are an active Helpdesk dealing with hundreds of tickets daily.,1
"Pros:Ce logiciel est très bon d'utilisation surtout dans des projets marketing rapide,sa me permet vite de communiquer mes chiffres d'affaires dans le monde entier",1
Very good cost benefit for the result that the software delivers.,1
Zoho Desk is an easy to learn help desk for most sized teams.,1
ServiceNow has allowed my team and me to assist users in my field as well as manage machine inventory. An easy-to-use tool with a plethora of functions and services.,1
"Customer support is terrible, they do have an unqualified customer success team. We requested a feature and it took them over 5 months with emails back and forth to let us know they can get it done. When i tried to cancel the contract they said we can not cancel it because you have another 1 year on a contract which was incorrect. the success manager was still thinking we are in 2019 after i pointed that out they still refused to cancel the contract. My advice to this company is a legacy and you should look into a more modern system and there is alot of them out there.",0
"The old interface was great - old, but great.There are a ton of bugs and UI/UX oversights in the new client. However, the new client is much better in terms of metrics and ticket reporting.",1
"Pros:It's easy to use and easy to integrate with other Zoho products, so it's easy to have all the customers information related",1
Good product,1
sorting the customer requestuser friendly,1
"We use Freshdesk for ticketing, knowledge base, user forums (just getting started with this) and for chat support.Overall, it has been a positive experience.There have been minor issues, as there are with all software, but I have been impressed with the support I have received from Freshdesk in times of need.I wish that they would be less restrictive on the middle tier for customization.Also the URL obfuscation when working on solution articles is incredibly annoying.I came from a Wordpress background and find Wordpress to be a much better experience for managing a knowledge base than Freshdesk.",1
"Pros:In a single platform you can collect, sort, manage dozens and dozens of emails and tickets.",1
Pros:Its an effective tool for tracking and managing bugs. Tool is intuitive and easy to use for beginners.,1
"If you use all Zendesk Suite, Chat it's a great add-on, and it's cost per agent it is fair enough when compared to all the metrics you can gather.",0
"Pros:It support wide range of customization, we use two Jiras one for service desk and support teams, which looks great and you can track your case SLAs in a very easy way, the 2nd Jira used for tracking with a fully other interface.",1
Average when we take support also in prespective.,1
"Overall, it does what you need it to do and they continue to improve the product.",1
It is a professional app which gives me almost all that I need to support our customers,1
"Software as a service, not having to maintain any softwareor hardware is always a big selling point.",1
"I couldn’t be any happier with Zendesk. From the different filtering, viewing. admin options and more, I totally feel good with this tool. Distributing tickets and following up with our customers has never been so easy. I love how new tickets are under an unassigned folder, which then can be assigned to or grabbed by anyone in the team. If a customer replies, it goes back to the person who initially responded the ticket which allows us to provide continuous follow-up. Another of my favorite options: private comments; it has helped us to save important information from the ticket/customer without having to use other tools.",1
"We have found it has improved our response times to inbound emails, and the speed at which we can reply and resolve customers' queries.",1
"Pros:My favorite part of Freshdesk is that it is the best tool (and definitely most affordable) to support multi-product brands. That is, if BrandA has ProductB and ProductC and ProductD and you want to filter tickets (and specifically TITLE them -- in the email subject line -- for the products they represent), you can do so easily with Freshdesk. Zendesk requires a higher tier payment plan for the same functionality, and the smaller/newer helpdesk services don't support this type of feature. Their support is very accessible and they will go the extra mile to ensure you get supported. They will even help with some development to some extent even if it falls outside the scope of the project.",1
My needs related to my job are getting fulfilled and it never disappoints me.,1
"Having used other tools for our ticket tracking, FreshDesk was easy to implement and adopt.",1
"Pros:Zoho Desk is so easy to use and see what has happened with the issue related to the ticket. Working as a team, we can see what other people have done on a ticket.",1
Pros:it is simple and very easy to use. It helps in online meetings and distributing work and managing project.,1
Zendesk have made support much easier allowing us to easily track and receive tickets throughout the company.,1
Pros:Easy to use interface for ticket support management,1
Pros:The options for customization is great.The interface looks great.I love the fact that it connects to Zoho CRM.,1

"Pros:Ease of use, Zoho desk is very helpful for managing efficiently different inboxes and tasks within a team",1

"permet de faire un suivi de ticket adapté, des reportings de qualitéle probleme est qu il nest pas assez personnalisable pour etre au plus vrai de la productionnous devons avoir des contournements pour ajouter des catégories",1
nil.,1
"Freshdesk is a highly performing help desk solution, with a professional issue based team that gives utmost assistance. More so, Freshdesk has articulate ticketing process, very efficient and fair for the customers requests.",1
Pros:Very user-friendly and easy to track tickets by organization.,1
Pros:O produto retorna praticidade e controle às demandas de Help Desk,1
It has been a great experience so far.We came from the old BMC remedy and we were looking for a modern ticketing solution. Freshdesk was a very refreshing update and made our life much easier.,1
In terms of management this gives some features. But I believe there should be more reports related to trends and patterns including line graphs. Currently we have to use a BI tool to get that done. Also it is good to have a documentation describing all the features and fields rather asking for FreshDesk support.,1
"Pros:Pros:Ease of use: Freshdesk has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for customer support agents to manage support tickets, collaborate on tickets, and provide timely support to customers.Multichannel support: Freshdesk supports multiple channels, including email, phone, chat, social media, and more. This allows businesses to manage customer inquiries from different channels in one place.Automation and self-service: Freshdesk provides automation and self-service tools, including chatbots, canned responses, and a knowledge base, to help businesses manage customer inquiries more efficiently.Reporting and analytics: Freshdesk provides reporting and analytics tools that enable businesses to track their support performance and identify areas for improvement.Integration with other tools: Freshdesk integrates with a wide range of other tools, including CRM, marketing automation, and e-commerce platforms, making it easy for businesses to manage their customer support in one place.",1
very easy to use and see all tickets made work a lot easier than you would expect,1
"We initially introduced the product to increase the efficiency and productivity of our agents. This has lead to our ques decreasing and many satisfied customers on our social media pages, as our response time has gone up and the unhappy customers have gone down due to our great service, all thanks to this product.",1
"As a user of Zoho Desk, I can say that my overall experience with the software has been fantastic. The platform is really easy to use and it has made managing customer support a breeze. I love how user-friendly it is and how simple it is to navigate. All in all, I'd highly recommend Zoho Desk to anyone looking for a hassle-free way to manage their customer support operations.",1
I think it’s a great alternative to Salesforce,1
"For a company that specializes in customer service, they are a joke. It takes several days to get a response from someone, you will never get support from someone in your time zone so when they do respond, it will be during overnight hours. They also will not have a phone number or post their working hours in their signatures. They don't even use their own product correctly-- I have received emails showing one name in the From line and a totally different name in the signature. Their automations will also send at inappropriate times-- I responded to an agent's request for more details, the agent responded and stated that they are working on the issue. Soon after, I received an automation stating they haven't heard from me and are closing the ticket. They will also try to charge you to get your data exported. Don't fall for it! There are free programs that will do this for you quickly and easily, including all of your Knowledgebase articles and the images associated with them. When importing to another system, you will need to reinsert the images within the articles because they are no longer hosted on Zendesk but the free export programs offered by competitors will name the files in a way that makes it clear and easy to identify which image goes where.",0
My experience with this tool is to be able to follow the requirements of our customers through the Tickets in OTRS.,0
"Pros:Ease of use for end user, email integrations, assigning tickets to person or team. Lots of integration and automation or selfservice options.",1
Reduce time to create and customize customer portals.Track time spent on requestsTrack external vs internal requests,1
"Really practical, it even has a mobile app that is very good on the go. Easy to use and straight forward.",1
We have a large network of small independent businesses so replying on a timely manner is critical. Freshdesk lets us prioritise urgent matters easily.,1
"Pros:Clean, easy to use interface. Great system for handling tickets.Love the built in knowledge base.",1
"We are a software-as-a-service company, that offers 24/7 support for our software-based products with very strict SLAs.Some of the issues need to be escalated to different support tiers and sometimes to engineering or product teams.",1
to improve the efficiency,1
We were able to seamlessly move issues from first level to second level support. Users can easily follow up on the status of our issues.,1
"Pros:The pricing is clear and easy to choose the best plan. We started using the tool for Customer Service ticket management first. With time, we decided to implement chat solution and a very decent tool was available in our plan.",1
"It is very easy to use and keep track of all your tickets, it has different views and the mobile app is pretty decent.",1
"Pros:It's easy to use and navigate, especially those using a platform like this for the first time. There is nothing too out of range for any level of business to best implement this within their businesses. Happy I found it.",1
"We have been using Freshdesk for 4.5 years.It's been a frustrating experience and has held our team back from working on actual customer service.Features disappear when the software is upgraded orrefreshed and you are required to upgrade your plan, $20/mo in my case, to access features that we had in the past but were taken away with a refresh.There is no notification of features being taken away, nor are you given the option to upgrade until you contact your account manager and are told about a price increase.",0
This solution has applied significant value to our org.,1
"It's our main customer support portal, so it's the key to everything in our business. It goes without saying that a bad customer ticketing system would kill our production, efficiency, and ultimately our sales renewals.",1
"A considerable improvement in client - provider communication. Organizes and greatly simplifies the control and information of each case that a client can request; improves response times and certainly provides support by having the information grouped in such a way that allows you to respond accurately, quickly and accurately every subject.",1
I like how easy to use and manage with teams and reaching/achieving goals with this tool that make possibilities come reality,1
Zendesk is one of the best tool i had ever used. It’s stress-free and less hassle when communicating customers.It also made me more productive at work by utilizing its feature.,1
just waiting to get a new period of trial,1
Pros:* Handling tickets is really easy and mostly can be done from a single page.* Forwarding messages from private inbox to the support inbox will automatically open a ticket with original sender.,1
"Overall, Zendesk was the right tool that helped us with an influx of emails when we could no longer keep a regular inbox organized, workout breaking the bank. Even though we could have gotten a lot more out of it by upgrading our account, for what we spent we were satisfied.",1
"Pros:Mi sono trovato bene nella gestione delle task in maniera agile, consigliato",1
"Great tool to provide support to customers, it adapts to any type of business, even the free version is very good.",1
"I uploaded and imported our contacts on a cloud. Also, I started a DIGITAL Marketing Business and got four contracts within the free trial. On the other hand, I'm thinking to become a ZOHO Dealer or the Arab world marketer to make ZOHO familiar in the region.",1
"This software is perfect for 1-3 customer service agents. It allows easy organization of tickets, and keeps agents efficient when they are answering inquiries. This is a great option for brands going from answering CS inquiries via email.",1

Pros:Simple and intuitive to use -my team adopted the software fairly easily and make use of it daily. The integration of the software into what we do has been seamless.,1
I would recommend it for anyone where cross-team collaboration is important.,1
"Really good, clear communication and allocation of tickets.",1
Pros:Ease of use.Search functionalityNotification systemProfessional feelCustomizationAccess of reports,1
Our live chat and help desk was more active with zoho desk. We are still in process of choosing zoho desk or one of its competitors for our organization.,0
Pros:Freshdesk is a great way for teams to stay organized and disperse job responsibilities in a ticket form. I really like that I can set service level agreements.,1
Pros:I can get notifications for service request on my mobile devices. I can manage service request outside of the office. I can assign calls on the fly.,1
Streamlining our support system. Earlier we were using an internally developed tool but it was slow and lacked lot of features. It's a rich feature packed product.,1
"Their support is probably the best support out there, a real 5-star experience, plus they are continuously implementing new features and create new products.As an administrator In my company, I really don't have to do a lot and I can easily do my job. There is almost no complaints from users.",1
What contact with customers and overview of all current business,1
"Pros:Ease of use, easy set up and good reports. The setup was a charm, was able to integrate with our domain and also we setup a tickets page for our customers.",1
"It's user experience is top notch and the collaboration feature is the lasting solution to team play, I enjoyed every bit of the software.",1
"Pros:Love how affordable it is, probably one of the cheapest customer management systems I've seen out there.",1

"We use ServiceNow for managing support requests coming in to IT, for IT change management, and application configuration management.It has proven to be stable and reliable.",1
"I am a Jira user of about 6 years, so of course I wanted to use it for my Service Desk instead of paying 19 a month for Freshdesk... Well, the pricing structure was terrible when it was release.They regrouped on version 2, re priced it and it is a GREAT product.Had it up and running in an hour, would go back.LOVE the customer portal, clean and effective.",1
"Our distributed crew was able to get together and focus on a single source of information. Now that all incidences are being recorded in one place, we have more insight into how things are progressing.",1
"The tool has increased the productivity of the team, due to the automation of many tasks that were done manually before.i personally use the tool to report the Support situation to the Top Management but, as I said before, I had to rebuild some dashboard externally (Excel) due to the weird result of some of the KPIs stored in the software.",1
"Pros:I loved the layout of Zendesk and how easy and clear it was to use. At my previous job, it was our primary way to communicate with customers, so I used it all day.",1
Pros:flexibility. we can personalize to our own business.some awesome videos and tutorial to see and learn.,1
User-friendly and reliable software. My experience so far is great and I would recommend it.,1
Pros:It makes our aupport operations fast and smoothI like that it is all in one solution Guests can easily and quickly navigate it,1
Overall a great experince over the last year or so. My team have greatly loved this new tool and as a LM it has allowed me to focus alot more on metrics and making my team efficient.,1
"JSM has been a great tool that helps us to organize our tickets. Like any good tool, setup, and management is KEY in implementation, but it has served us well.",1
Pros:Value for money and the work flow functionality.,1
"Stress reliever: It was hard for me to remember everything and then disperse the information to the right people on my team.Now they can access the information themselves without relying on me remembering or being there to tell them what the request was. Also the support was excellent, I needed some assistance and I worked with the same person through the whole process, which was great!! She followed up with me until my problem was resolved!!",1
"Zendesk is the CS tool which helps users reach out to us and is a good tool to generate reports, segregate users, improve users experience in reaching out to support team.",1
Overall Zoho desk is pretty much helpful if you are established your paws into a niche market and want to help your customers by providing proper services. Free version might lack some crucial features but you still can be able to handle much more without paying much for start. Learning curve is for non technical people hence one should understand the semantics of each tab.,1
"I use Zendesk when I seasonally work as a CSR for an online company during their periodic launches.I don't have to re-learn it each time, which is nice. I like the ease of finding past tickets. Not a fan of the chat feature.",1
Pros:The ticket receiving time is fast comparing to other tools. They takes at least 5-10 minutes to be appeared in other support softwares. So I really like it,1
"Overall, working with Zendesk has been a breeze. It's user-friendly, simple and quick. The Zendesk team is always available to answer questions or help you pull reports. I never want to use another ticketing system.",1
The integration with our current CRM proved to be invaluable. Information sharing between the two departments will help us streamline communications within our organisation to provide a smoother client experience.,1
"Pros:We do a lot of business where we need to have things right at our fingertips in this day and age. It is so convenient to be able to toggle between, the inability to do this with our previous software. It has a huge impact on the speed and accuracy of service we are able to provide our clients all day-every day. The fact that we can even be in a customer's account and be chatting with help is phenomenal. We can still do our work in real time, something that can seem so small is a HUGE deal for us!",1
"Time saving functionality on many levels. Less emails in your inbox, and less hitting the forward button. Best part, if you're using Zendesk, you can import your emails from there when you get started. The functions in the free version are fantastic. Help desk, HELPS, but responding quickly. All private messages on a ticket or message are kept together with the email chain and kept private (unless you want the client to see the message). Recommend this product",1
"I would recommend Zendesk overall as a simple and easy-to-use ticketing systems. It works for our organization and we are in the medium to large business size, but I bet it would work just as great for smaller businesses.",0
"The time savings across departments are massive, and it has allowed us to have a much more joined up and structure approach across our business.

Being able to control support queries and set up rules that allocate them to certain groups is overwhelmingly helpful. This not only saves time but ensures that no query is missed.,1
Allowed initial tracking of client issues for our software,1
"I would highly recommend Zendesk Suite to any organization looking to improve their customer support just like i recommend to use Zendesk Suite for the customer support in my current organization.

Despite its complexity and cost, I would still consider Zendesk Suite to be a must-have tool for any organization looking to empower their customer support",1

The customizable knowledge base and advanced reporting and analytics are also seen as valuable features.",1
"I would definitely recommend Zendesk when it comes to a ticket system for around 10-12 people. But once you exceed around that amount and/or want very detailed reporting, goals, statistics, trends, etc., I would recommend a more intricate ticket system.",1
Pros:Integration into CRM platform so agents can access all customer data easilySetup was a breeze and we were up and running in less than a day,1

This software does everything Brandmotion needs it to do!!! The customer portal is phenomenal.Customers can log tickets through the portal. It connects to Zoho CRM.

"Pros:Freshdesk is the simplest and easiest to use ticket system that I have come across.Its relatively simple to get up and running, and adding/removing agents (without affecting reports) couldn't be easier.There are a large number of plugins available, and we can create our own automation with their version of macros (for example, I have an email go out to the ticket creator if a ticket was created during off-business hours).In my experience, configuring such automatic replies and other simple reactive actions is much more difficult in other ticket system tools, and Freshdesk aces this.Other than that, I have never lost anything - nothing is better than reliability.We're approaching 100,000 total tickets, and accessing ticket number 1 is just as easy now as it was when we first rolled out the solution.",1
"At first, feels complex and redundant, but while you pour into it, it starts feeling like a solution and keeper of daily work, management, and tasks.It is also incredibly functional.",1

Pros:Easy to use and set up. Setup entire team in under two hours without previous knowledge of the software.Menus and setup are intuitive.,1
Freshdesk on its own is wonderful but more work needs to be done so it can be used with the other Fresh sites.,1

This has been really productive in resolving issues as you don't need to bring anyone up to speed on the ticket or interrupt their current workflow. Just a simple @ and when they get a chance they can look over the ticket and respond. I would also like to commend FreshDesk support team. They are always quick to answer any questions.",1

It is simply the best tool to answer support request from clients and send issue to the development team directly in Jira.,1
"Pros:ZenDesk makes it easy to manage your Support/Customer Service queue, offering a user-friendly dashboard, custom modes for communicating with users/customers, and bench marking statistics, both within your team and against industry averages, that help you understand how you stack up against other team members as well as competitors. With such a vast database of industries within their portfolio, ZenDesk has been able to optimize their system, helping businesses across the business spectrum. Have used this software in different industries, and it is responsive to all types of Support communication. Also gives businesses the ability to customize their system, which allows for a great feel/branding opportunity in some cases.",1
"This is a great internal tool for a company. But if you try and take it outside to our customers that are using our application, it really isn't designed for that market. We had to go with Zendesk. The ability to create tickets that are linked to the main issue to get assigned to the proper resources to fix is not user friendly at all.",0
I have mixed feeling about it overall. It costs less than some rivals but I'm disappointed with the website templates for the support sites.,0
"Important gain de temps et surtout une meilleure gestion des demandes des clients.Rappels, alerte.. Une très bonne solution de gestion des incidents",1
Pros:The project tracking in Agile world has become easy with JIRA. The creation of backlogs for each EPIC gives fair idea of sub-tasks at the initial stage itself enabling me to assign it to right individuals.

"Prior to using Jira Service Desk, were using a combination of Excel and SharePoint with workflows. We couldn't get great reports. It was hard to customize. Workflows broke without a reason because, you know, it's SharePoint. And the entire process of serving customers was dead slow. We brought in Jira Service Desk as a test bed. Within 2 hours, we were testing and customers were putting in tickets. While we used most of the default settings, the value we were generating was way beyond we ever had. Then, we set up SLAs and watch reports for a few days. We were able to see everything we wanted - who reported the issue, when, what was the priority, how many comment exchanges happened, how much time did we spend, did we meet SLAs, what was the solution, etc. Fast forward 2 years. We are now able to create strategies to service internal and external customers better based on the data from Jira. It has helped us go from making gut-feel decisioning to data-centric decisioning. Good data wins debates. Jira helped us with good data.We are also utilizing Jira's excellent searching, dashboarding and API functionality to feed data to other systems and drive changes beyond just customers.",1
In just a few short months we were able to implement Jira Service Desk for our internal use.It was truly pain free and tied in with the self help portal the user adoption was great. The reporting and SLA tracking is great and can't imagine going to any other product.,1

In short, it has helped us to provide personalized, real-time customer service and support to our clientele, thus boosting customer satisfaction and efficiently streamlining problem resolution.",1
"Zoho Desk helps businesses organize their affairs, manage customer interactions, and structure their way of dealing with customers. Our support agents can readily get information and answers from the customisable knowledge base within Zoho Desk. We employed a reporting tool to have a better understanding of our support desk and future difficulties.",1
I wouldn't want to use anything else but Zendesk. I couldn't imagine doing my job without it honestly. 1000/10 would recommend!,1
"Great experience. As an admin, or process coordinator you get a great overview of the agent's operation. How many tickets have been assigned to each, the status, how much time it takes to get the tickets resolved and of course it makes it easier to make decisions.We did not use any software before and we constantly got lost e-mails or forgotten requests because they were all handled through e-mail. Also it was very difficult to keep track of the agents performance.",1

"Great way to central requests coming from a support department, such as IT, creative, marketing etc.",1
"We've tried a handful of ticketing systems, but Zendesk has been the most user friendly and almost fully functional immediately upon sign up. Zendesk also integrates with numerous other options to improve the communication between platforms. The only downside is they don't offer customer satisfaction reviews with the lower plans and as a newer user to ticketing, it would be very helpful to have feedback on our client's experience withZendesk ticketing.",1
"I am really happy since using Zendesk. I actually look forward to getting support tickets!I develop & sell software to consumers. I use support techs who work out of their home. It's not always easy bringing them up to speed on some of the more complex technical issues.We used to use straight email. I did not get to see what my employees were telling customers, so I couldn't monitor the quality of service, and give the employees training when required. Now I can see what they are saying, and I can jump in and assist in some of the more complex cases.When I answer support tickets, I am more motivated to give detailed answers, because I can refer my employees to my replies, and they can learn.Now that we all share access to the pool of support tickets, we can give more prompt replies, and customers get faster service. Customers are much more forgiving when they see answers in minutes instead of hours or days. When a customer is thinking of buying and sends us a question, he is more likely to buy if the answer comes back in minutes, and he is still in a buying frame of mind.I love being able to tell at a glance the status of all our outstanding support issues.The Markdown codes enable us to use typographic features to better lay out out replies, making them clearer and more easy to understand.I like the email format that Zendeskuses. It is the most natural and convenient way to communicate with customers. I like that customers don't have to sign into a ticket management app if they don't want to.We tried using a Support Forum so that customers could get access to all past support answers. That did not work out, as some disgruntled customers left nasty and overly negative comments for all to see, which would discourage prospective customers.I am going to tell all my software developer colleagues about Zendesk.Now if you could add Tables to the Markdown code, Zendesk would be beyond perfect.",1
"I have 700+ internal users and sometimes having external users to raise their questions via helpdesk, most of those using email and some of them use the portal to create ticket. It allows me to manage these enquiries in one single platform, and oversee how my agents solving the problems. Freshdesk also provide me a platform to make announcements and create knowledge base to enable users to be self-help while my manpower is limited. Its reports is regularly used, to provide senior management figures for review of work.",1
We can generate the reports regarding pending and completed tickets,0
Once set-up it's easy to use. Very reliable and stable.,1
Pros:Great amount of features and easy way to configure almost everything,1

Pros:Ease of use. A company/brand that's reputable. Outages are very rare. Makes communicating with customers extremely easy.,1
"Freshdesk is used by support teams within organizations. It was implemented to replace the use of group mailboxes as the support team grew. The centralized management of support email quickly proved its value. Since then, we have also implemented a solution tool (knowledge base) as a central guidance repository for our user base to supplement the training resources we provide. Freshdesk is perfect for any support team using email or social media to help users. It's flexible enough to become a central element of your online presence once you find your way into the admin section and set up a look and feel that fits your company's style. The most important question when choosing help desk software is obviously how you want to support your customers and finding software that does exactly that.",1
Freshdesk has been a great solution for our team which has allowed us to fill a gap to collect implementation issues during our projects. The Freshdesk support staff have all been excellent and quick to respond. They even have helped out when we migrated our domain and needed to switch account names to align with rebranding the company. They're definitely worth checking out!,1
"Pros:We like the options very much a lot of things are possible, also automatization so we can respond to our customers faster and help them better.",1
"Pros:I like how Zendesk grows with my business, If I expand the business I can expand my Zendesk in a few clicks",1
Pros:We used a Zoho desk as an ITSM tool for SOC and IT ticket management. It helps us to manage and track the status of ongoing requests and issues.,1
"In these short weeks, Zoho proved to be easy to use and labor saving. Cost per agent would be an issue to consider.",1
Overall its a very good software in terms of usability. Happy with this.,1
"Antes de que los teléfonos y los correos electrónicos se mezclaran, nuestros sistemas se separaron en dos sistemas separados. Las llamadas procesan los tickets de manera diferente a los correos electrónicos. La mayoría de las preguntas de nuestros clientes llegaron a través de llamadas telefónicas y correos electrónicos. Los clientes pueden registrar fácilmente sus consultas con Facebook y WhatsApp; esto les facilita hacer preguntas. Al conectar Zendesk a estos dos canales, los clientes pueden llamar al sistema con menos frecuencia y más fácilmente.",1
The available platform in reaching out customers it is our service desk as well when we need assistance. Effective engagement within the organization.,1
Zendesk platform allows us to manage tickets from customers,1
ServiceNow is an ITSM tool and it has so many modules based on business process. It is very helpful to track and troubleshoot issues in better way.,1
"Pros:I like that the setup was easy. Within less than an hour of signing up, I was already communicating our company's brand new support site as well as support email. I also like how easy it was to map to my website sub-domain. I've checked everything else and we always go back to Zoho Desk.I also like the tight integration with Zoho CRM. I've always thought that a Help Desk app and a CRM app needs to be seamlessly integrated.",1
"IT's been great, it's so easy and it rarely fails, I have never had to talk to their support staff about anything. So great app.",1
"Pros:Zoho Desk provides more features for your help desk witch a less price when you compare with the competitors! Its a really complete help desk system, test it and see with your own eyes.",1
"If you know how to tag anything, you can pick up the whole process within minutes of using it for the first time. You can create contacts at the site of entry, which makes everything faster and easier. Even those who are not software-savvy won't find it a challenge. A plus if you're retro-fitting this process onto an existing business SOP. Zendesk is especially good for teams that work digitally, rather than meeting in a physical space, as it helps keep communication open and easy to access for everyone.",1
"Pros:Integrated with the zoho suite, integrated with phone system",1
Pros:Robus system - it never failed on us when we used it.,0
"We were using it track calls made to our support organization, and to track tickets created through other softwares. We pushed it into Salesforce.",1
It was good that Jira Service Desk helped us on the customer support area. It speeds up our team's productivity and had made a good impression to our customers for us!,1
I love zendesk and use and need it in my everyday life at work. I believe zendesk is going in the right direction for sure and should be utilized by more people.,1
"Pros:As a team we've been using many ticket sofwares for our own software service. Jira is the most trusted, best value for it's price and easier to use one amongs them all.",1
"Overall, I'd say that the Zendesk Suite multichannel support has been a lifesaver. Managing the customer interactions in only one platform gives us an overview in the life cycle of each customer. It helps agents see the bigger picture the customers are having, be proactive in terms of resolutions, they can spot trends and also see what self help articles the customers used. Zendesk's suite reporting and dashboards are giving us a useful insight in how our team is performing and we can easily spot areas of improvement, while celebrating each success we have.",1
Not as easy as it should be to find what I am looking for on the site.,0
"We are receiving a lot of request of customers. The customers are sending the requests to the same email address. So often it's not clear for us who of us is responsible for which request. So it happened from time to time that a customer email remained unanswered.It also happens often that different people are responsible for a different stage of a request. Freshdesk is a great solution for these problems. Now one person is responsible for the tickets that are coming in to Freshdesk and assign them then to the right people. Furthermore, we have stuff that is taking care of our service phone, sitting in other countries. Freshdesk helps us to control the quality of they calls and also to communicate with them. So all in all I have a very good experience with Freshdesk.",1
The use of Freshdesk is what makes us different from other outsourcing companies here in Cebu. We attain to have 1 platform that could capture data requests from all the support channels our clients used and Freshdesk is the tool for it. I would say its our scaling factor.,1
"Pros:Easy to add tags, add filters, look at reports on how the team has been doing.",1
"This software has allowed me to organize my work effectively, and ensure that all my clients get their tasks done accurately, and on time.",1
better customer support,1
Great overview of task pending with our programming team. Extremely helpful to keep track of sprints. Learning curve is relatively low.,1
"We had some issues before, but all good nowThe system is stable and function well",1

I can manage all the daily jobs with Freshdesk and sort them by priority.,1
"Pros:The platform is good for internal and external knowledge base building, and I think the mobile app is extremely useful when it comes to support with tickets and the chatbots",1
"The Zoho Desk's ease of use is what I appreciate most about it. Even for non-technical users, the platform's overall user interface is welcoming, and it makes it simple for people to get started.",1
"Overall, I'm quite happy with Zendesk.",1
An amazing experience for sure. I started off with this helpdesk and immediately grasped how to use it to my advantage. I was able to check the team's overall performance at a glance using the Reporting feature. We could set up responses for common scenarios which made the agents' life a bit easier and improved output.,1
"Help us on a daily basis, improve our customer service",1
"Overall, a generally positive experience to use this product every day for work. Allows us to provide quick support for users and does have several good features.",1

"Our ticketing nightmare has become a thing of the past, we have live chat features that allows our Web users contact us directly. It's really nice.",1
"Super recommended tool, facilitates ticket assignment and monitoring, in addition to keeping the end user informed",1
Pros:I like the ease of access to have visibility into large amounts of tickets. The categories to divide between work nice.,1
Solid...5 stars for performance.,1
Pros:We have been using zendesk for more than two years and love it. It's the best tool for our customer support staff.,1
"Um dos problema que solucionei foi de assertividade nas entregas, uma vez que antes era realizado totalmente de forma informal, sendo assim, não mantendo grandes controles das atividades desenvolvidas, bem como os status das mesmas.",1
Hot deals. Zoho Desk gives exactly dazzling results. It has built the best for my clients.,1

It helps 1 person IT dept have 1 central place for people to ask for help instead of getting bombarded by 200 emails.,1
A functional and feature-rich ticketing system,1
Overall average - would have been above average if not for the pricing.,1
Overall it was a great experiencing with Freshdesk. Made our life easier in managing and communicating the users quite often. We can fetch the data and also we get the ticket IDs for the users where we can follow up with user.,1
"We ended up having so much feedback from clients who routinely had large file attachments that were rejected on our plan level, and who wanted to use the actual portal themselves to check their ticket status that we looked into other options before upgrading. We found an alternative that we switched to and saved over 50% in cost, and got all the features we wanted. I think this platform was simply made to be the right fit for larger enterprises and I'm sure it's the cream of the crop in those situations.",1
"It was very difficult to deploy OTRS, you need a very skilled team to achieve a minimum useful configuration",0
Pros:Easy to Manage and Integration with many third party services.,1
"We're using Jira to manage our tickets and it works well. There are solid alternatives and competitors in the field, so I'm not sure for how long we'll keep using jira.",1
I'm using it to Answering help desk for a self booking tool. Registering data and performing reporting to understand recurrence. Measuring client happiness.,1
"Freshdeskfrom our users is crucial as a consumer app. With Freshdesk, our customers can quickly and easily send us comments or concerns, and my staff can quickly and simply respond and stay in touch with the customer. Each feedback ticket may then be monitored to ensure it was addressed and resolved in a timely manner.",1
Very efficient.,1
"Je suis extrêmement satisfait de Freshdesk en tant que solution de gestion de service client. Le logiciel est très facile à utiliser, avec une interface intuitive qui permet de gérer rapidement et efficacement toutes les demandes des clients.La fonctionnalité de ticketing est particulièrement utile, car elle permet de suivre facilement les problèmes et de les résoudre rapidement.

C'est une solution de premier ordre, avec une excellente équipe de support qui est toujours là pour aider.",1
"Pros:La caratteristica che preferisco in Service Now è la facilità d'integrazione con altri applicativi/servizi per cui i flussi possono essere personalizzati a seconda delle esigenze (ad esempio integrando Snow con altri applicativi è possibile classificare le mail in funzione di determinate keywords)Con Snow si possono gestire allo stesso tempo le richieste interne all'azienda (richieste di uffici verso altri uffici), sia le richieste di utenti esterni. Vengono monitorati i tempi di evasione delle richieste e per questo motivo difficilmente si creano dei backlog.",1

Even though I didn't use all the integrations it has with other platforms, I'm aware my coworkers were happy with the ease of use.",1
So far I have to say this solution is unbelievable. Seems to do everything we need and at a fraction of the cost of our current tool set. We have also initiated contact regarding HCM and CRM as all our solutions are under review and having them all on the same platform makes sense,1

"We have moved from Desk.com half a year ago. The decision was made based on our comparison. We have selected Freshdesk as it seemed to give the best value for the price and people also seem really satisfied in general. To me Freshdesk is a developing underdog on the CRM market with some huge advantages and opportunities. We selected them because we can have some top notch solutions just like we had Freshdesk or Zendesk, but we do not have to leave a fortune there. They still need to spend a lot to improve the software as the market is really competitive with other companies like Salesforce, Zendesk but it seems they have the ambition to be the best.Moving to Freshdesk still seems a great decision.",1

"Pros:I like that Zoho has a lot of options when it comes to integration tools. You can customize the system,",0
"We use this as our customer-facing portal because it's very easy for customers to use, but it's certainly not as good as other products out there for user support. Integration with email is key, though, and they do that pretty well. We do still have a lot of issues with Spam, and it's not something our developers ever want to use.",0
"Pros:Zendesk was our number one (and still is) choice for implementing a chat on various websites that we managed for our clients. The functions are elaborative, they display various metrics about the person you are adressing and will program several responses as well. It's simple and very easy to use.",1
its the best,1

"Pros:I love that there is an app, so I can keep up with my support duties even when on the go. I like being able to report on tickets based on the client to see who needs the most support. This helps us know how we might improve our training. Being able to set our own Types is very helpful. Generic types just wouldn't do us much good. You can create macros for those tickets that can be answered with a standard email. Also, we have it set to respond to the client after a certain number of days if the ticket is pending. That prompts the client to reply and keeps us from having to wade through pending tickets manually and email the client. There is a lot more than I can learn about using the product which is also a plus! I have never used the help feature myself, so I cannot really rate that.My coworker has been pleased, though.",1

One of the best multi tool platforms I have ever used. It is crucial to our operation.,1
"Pros:Yes, it is very easy to use and userfrindly.",1
"I really do like the product and as an IT developer, I have used Zendesk for many of my clients. The set up and integration process is quite easy, though the client often needs trainings to be able to use some features but overall experience is still on the positive side. I personally love how organize the platform is and their record keeping makes life so easy for users. I really do recommend this product, the price can be a bit on the high side but the benefits are worth it.",1
"Jira Service Desk has very powerful and customizing SLA, we use it to keep track of every ticket and engage our customer with our quick responses.Keep in mind that JSD work with JIRA built in workflow, so you can customize your workflow as how the work is done in your company.It would be better for us if the SLA could publish to customer, for more transparent comunication.",1

- It was smooth to use and the faster assistance as a Helpdesk Assistant can be given.- Can easily track any Ticket ID,1
Overall experience has been awesome. I am really proud of the choice to integrate use Freshdesk over any other product. It integrates really smoothly with all of our products. Customers have never raised any complaints with the ease of navigation within the product.

The Experience is generally worth it.,1
"Pros:You can sign up to three agents at no cost and link them using a common email address, making this the perfect system for customer service. It's easy to assign tickets to agents, create canned responses and report on progress.",1
I am very impressed with the level of service and the solution provided. There is a constant view to make sure we as users are happy and able to carry out tasks with out any effort.,1
We have been very satisfied with our migration to Freshdesk and will be moving our other ticketing systems over as well.Any time we have had to reach out to their support team they have been quick to respond and have solved our issues promptly.,1

Pros:Automatisation très prometteuse et efficace,1
Pros:You can see the progress of your case and where are the slow point in this progress. This is a great software for larger teams to track the lack of the team members. It did not add any value in out of 3-4 members. But by using the tracking progress you can see what team member is slowing down the process.,1
"In concept ZOHO's invoicing and contact database sound good. Problem with importing from excel on quickbooks inventory and contacts. Three days and despite calls and emails..no return response except for an autoresponder saying thank you for starting your trail and if you have any questions call us. Right! What the heck do you think we've been trying to do. We finally get on a call from somewhere like India support and the call is dropped, no resolution, no call back. We are dropped and totally in the dark. To make matters worse, i tried to log into our account from my lap top and guess what...all the data I MANUALLY entered was gone! Now that doesnt make me feel good about ZOHO PERIOD!",0
Immediate support. easy tool to implement,1
Pros:It’s easy to set up and use and has great tools. It’s also good for saving money because there are no subscription costs and no charges for upgrades.,1
"I use JIRA to track all the work that I do as an engineer on my team. It helps me track of anything I pick up, organize upcoming work according to epics and prioritize work as needed. We also share this informaiton with our stakeholders so they can keep track of what's happening with each project.",1
Pros:The pros are definetly the possibility to create personalized filters and manage tickets from various countries and clients.,0
Overall this software tool has been exceptionally useful to our operation.Freshdesk has been a valuable tool for solving our growing need for trackable customer interaction.,1

We’re able to more efficiently provide support to our customers using Zendesk.This is critical to our business.,1
"My overall experience with Freshdesk is positive. My company uses another piece of software to track Bugs and development tasks, so we use Freshdesk exclusively for requests of our Web team. The ease of use of this software made it really quick to learn and definitely makes ticket tracking more transparent.",0
"When we used his product it work very well, things plug in easily",1
"Pros:Way cheaper than zendesk, great reports and easier customizations. The analytics is very insightfull, the prices are very affordable for any business and even the trial version is already better than any other",1

Pros:The built-in analytics and the search database function.,0
"Not bad at all, would recommend to others looking for a ticketing system that works well.",0
"Creating and organizing support tickets based off of incoming emails/phone calls.It gives you the ability to have multiple eyes on a support issue, although for us there was mainly only one person handling these issues.In our case it was used to track issues, see them thru to completion, and track issue types/resolution times on an ongoing basis.",1
"I've used ZenDesk for over 4 years, and it's the best help desk tool out there!Whether you just need a simple email-based help desk or a full-on enterprise-level multi branded instance with voice and chat (I've had both), it never feels overwhelming to configure. It's easy to navigate, it's super customizable, and has tons of ready-made integrations with the other applications you already use (that work perfectly out of the box). They practice what they preach: not only will you get amazing service every time, but access to a treasure trove of well-written product documentation plus other soft-skill resources to help your team refine their customer service chops.",1
Pros:A facilidade em abrir chamados para outras áreas da empresa,1
"Once past the cumbersome process of agreeing on workflows and setting everything up, the journey with Jira Service Desk has been pretty smooth.

Wir sind soweit sehr zufrieden und für unsere Zwecke ist das eine sehr gute Software,1

The overall experience with JIRA Service Management is super great and it made our contract management way more efficient.,1
Pros:We use Freshdesk daily. It helps us manage our emails. We also use our chat functions. There's so many amazing features on Freshdesk.,1
A wonderful tool to have on our Resort website! This tool has helped my team and myself close sales in less than 15 mins. Definitely a great tool for support as well. It's a faster and convenient way for clients to reach out to us and get information which leads to great costumer service! My team is very satisfied with Zendesk Chat and we look forward to its continuous updates! It is part of our sales & support team! Keep up the good job!,1
Its easy to manage projects with and allows you to easy track tasks,1
"Zendesk replaced our legacy ticket system, which was clunky and not cloud-based. With Zendesk being in the cloud, we can access customer information, ticket details, etc. from wherever we are. Perhaps most importantly, it permitted customers to give direct feedback as soon as a ticket is marked closed. This has been an invaluable tool for us in evaluating whether we're providing top-notch support.",1
Pretty good but support team were not ideal. Salesforce integration was horrible and took them too much timeto fix it,1
Pros:The user friendliness of this software amazes my team every day. A long time search has come to an end.,1
Zoho Desk has been always my tool to analyze my support tickets statsand it help me play around with the data that is generated from different reports.Its is very useful in assigning tickets based task to team members also helps in monitoring client support tickets logged on it and retrieving all history /steps of action performed on the ticket. It helped me to maintain different SLAs of the client and in case of breaching the SLA it raises a flag and escalation to line manager which is a very good feature and practical.,1
Allows me to organize customer service calls by adding notes to calls to keep track of customer service inquiries.It is easy to share things with teammates around tickets.,0
Very good experience. Helpful software for us. We'll keep using it.,1
It was overall nice.,1
"Pros:I like the ticketing system in general.It is amazing.It keeps everything in order.It tracks everything incredibly.I know what everything is related to, when I've touched it, who else has touched it, I can pass it on to others easily, I can take over things quickly.Its so freaking perfect I love this software",1
"Pros:It comes with great live chat features and makes a great help desk solutionIn addition, I like the knowledge base features and the fact that it makes customer service easy",1
Very Good,1
Pros:I love the ease of following a ticket and collaborating on issues with my team. Easy to use once the ticket has been created.,1
Pros:Knowledge base is easy in use and very helpfull in tickets. But I would like to see templating works better and with easier code. Now it makes pretty shitty code and for example no user friendly URL is possible.,0
Pros:Reporting and the notification system. Can see the pending and closed issues perfectly sorted out. Can handle the support calls easily,1
"Je suis totalement dégouté de cette entreprise. J'ai eu une offre d'essai startup afin de tester le produit et voir la valeur de l'outil. Les codes fournis pour la réduction ont mal fonctionné, j'ai donc mis du temps à mettre en place l'outil. Ensuite au bout de 6 mois, pas de mail de notification, il est compliqué d'avoir un Sales disponible. J'ai résilié et 2 mois après, à ma grande surprise ils m'ont débité 2,x 222 € !!!! pour un outil que je n'ai pas utilisé et que j'ai résilié. J'ai fait un ticket support et ça a mis 1 mois pour avoir un retour ! (ZENDESK vend des solutions de gesetion de client et support et leur niveau interne est proche du néant, j'ai rarement vu autant de médiocrité).J'ai demandé le remboursement (tout du moins un geste), voici leur réponse :Upon checking, I see that the subscription renewed for service period 12/07/2021 and the account owner cancelled the account on 01/07/2021. Kindly note that cancellation must occur no less than 30 days prior to account renewal date as is required by the terms of our MSA. With this, my sincere apologies, but we are unable to provide your refund as requested as your cancellation did not occur 30 days prior to your renewal date as is required by the terms of our MSA. > Donc en gros, support Froid, pas d'empathie, ils veulent juste gagner de l'argent et se moque de leur ecosysteme de startups partenaires. Des VOLEURS!Je n'ai jamais écris un avis sur une entreprise, mais aujourd'hui je suis révolté.",0
We ahve now disabled Direct Email support and now have all tickets directly logged via the web portal which means that end users are now more likely to use the online knowledge-base which means that issues can be resolved faster and provide a better customer experience and fast response time.,1
"The negative customer support experience far overshadows any product benefits. I would recommend a complete overhaul of Zendesk Customer Support. Management that implemented the current customer support system should be replaced. A company supplying customer support software should set the standard, not be the reason people discontinue use. I would not recommend Zendesk based solely on Customer Support.",0
"Pros:Jira Service Management provides a powerful ticketing system that allows organizations to create, track, and manage support tickets and issues efficiently.",1
"This tool allows you to focus more on your customers, have them closer and the attention they receive makes them happy. Having your customers happy means that your company is going in the right direction. Without a doubt a very complete and efficient tool.",1
Painful in terms of getting what we need. The software is good but everything else around it is a let down,1
Pros:Anything that you may need - help with a printer to submitting a monthly construction draw - is seamlessly done through service now by submitting a ticket.,1
Pros:Es facil e intuitivo y permite trabajar en equipo,1
Still trialing but so far so good.,1
Pros:Tracking customer's challenges and resolving them.Also being able to get a report of the highest number of cases each team member has treated.,1
Overall experience has been amazing so far as it is able to cater our day to day needs. Great platform to provide internal/external support.,1
Pros:Integrations with other Zoho Productsquick to get set-up easy customization.easy onboarding with team membersLots of options.,1
"Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the software. The mobile access allows me to manage my business at any time.",1
"Clear, easy way to manage all your service requests with the ability to assign status and due dates for follow up.",1
Pros:Easy to start with a basic free setup and upgrade on organization's demands or develops the need for more features.The best thing is it is very easy to manage tickets by automation rules so agents can see their tickets in their system automatically.,1
Pros:I like how organized and customizable this software is. My company was able to place custom macros for responding emails. This allowed for responses to be sent out conveniently faster.,1
"Using it for over 2 years now and when we have an issue, support is fast and helpful.",1
"Pros:It is easy to use, a very friendly application.Excellent to keep track of all cases and existing emails within an organization.Meets expectations",1
I had a great experience with Zendesk,1
JIRA customer support has been extremely unhelpful. Several tickets and requests have been issued (from several customers) in their customer portal with no response or solutions offered.,0
"Muchas ventajas con el manejo y seguimiento de tickets, me gusta la opción de poder buscar por palabras o numeros",1
"Pros:We needed a unique customer service software that would allow vendors outside of our organization to have access to collaborate on tickets, while not providing them complete access to our system nor the ability to communication with customers directly. Zoho's Light Agent feature was the perfect solution. With the paid subscription for Zoho Desk, you can add as many Light Agents as you need which allows you to provide the best service possible to your customers.",1
easy for handling client queries,0
We used Zoho Desk to get complete our projects. We had multiple projects and needed a place to manage every assignment.,1
Pros:Zoho Help desk is easy to use and it has a nice search feature for going through your tickets. You're able to see other employees looking at your tickets and you're able to make comments on the fly. Its very basic and you can create different ticket systems for your clients as well. I found that Zoho was the easiest help desk service I have used to date. I would also like to add that Vault is a great password feature if you use Help Desk. They work with each other very well.,1
"For our small IT department, FreshDesk is a cost-effective ticket solution that works well with our existing IT systems and allows us to keep a mostly-internal knowledge base up to date easily.",1
Pros:this product is very easy to use. me and my employees are always using it to ask questions or fix issues,1
"Overall, good experience. I have reviewed and used other products and Zendesk is the best.",1
Pros:The knowledge based and the automation features are the most useful. They help our help portal stand out.,1
"We obtained permission to implement new tracking systems and referrals to VIP Retail customers, referring to those with considerable monthly volume spending, so that the contact is not lost, we can use Zoho to generate a friendly contact via email that links us through a link to the program and discuss future preferences, it also serves to answer via page any quick questions they have about the post-sale of a product.",1
"Pros:It's a really efficient way to work as a team on many things at the same time, and not lose track of anything.",1
"Pros:The layout, ability to BCC people, the ability to add articles to an automated answer. The integrations offered.",1
"Best Service management tool which providesscalability, flexibility andgreat collaboration. It provides various feature CMDB(configuration management database), Knowledge database and intelligence workflow automation. It provides best ticket management.",1
"Automation Anywhere, Inc. had many processes which involved extensive usage of excel spreadsheet for compiling the data and generating the reports. We were not happy with the one software as it had it's own limitations in generating reports, tickets assignments..etc. In due course of time it became very difficult for us to maintain the spreadsheets and extract reports. We started evaluating Zendesk extensively and found that it was way ahead of it's competitors in terms of ease of use and we strongly felt that we got the right helpdesk software. It's now one year and 6 months and we are very happy, and pleased, to be associated with Zendesk. Implementation of Zendesk was not that difficult. The Support team was very cooperative and helped us right from the word go, and even suggested better solutions forour queries. The training curve of Zendesk is so short that it does not take much time for my support experts to learn it. Our support experts are now comfortable in using Zendesk. After using Zendesk now we are able to measure the KPI's of our support experts very easily and we are happy to say that we do not use excel spread sheet to maintain our customer's data. In fact, after the implementation of Zendesk, the next step was the integration of Zendesk with Sales Force - which was successful and helped our support team and Sales team getting connected. To conclude - We are happy and love to be associated with Zendesk.",1
it was ok not sure why company switched but they did the job i would’ve kept using them.,1
Pros:Having a central place to have issues presented was great.,0
"Pros:Very flexible tool, very useful in seeking assistance especially to our IT team, very simple and user friendly",1
Pros:It keeps us on track with of service requests and stay on top of different projects.,1

"The great utility that this tool offers is fascinating, it has served me both for work and personal use. Within my company we usually use this tool to communicate with our clients from all over the country, it also makes our work easier since it is available on mobile phones and we can use it wherever we are.",1

"Pros:Easy to use, friendly UI. You can set workflows on your own for each projects. User role management is great.",1

We use the tool to solve tickets and develop solution articles for our clients,1
"Pros:Zendesk est un outil pratique et facile à utiliser.Une bonne documentation utilisateur et également technique est à disposition.Possibilité d'utiliser API Zendesk depuis d'autre outils pour créer par exemple des ticket automatiquement, ou pour synchroniser des donées.",1
Pros:The tracking system of every JIRA ticket.,1
"Di recente ho iniziato a utilizzare Freshdesk come software per il servizio clienti per la mia piccola impresa. Prima di Freshdesk, utilizzavo una combinazione di e-mail e un sistema di helpdesk di base, ma man mano che la mia attività cresceva, avevo bisogno di una soluzione più solida. All'inizio ero intimidito dall'enorme numero di funzionalità e opzioni di Freshdesk, ma dopo aver passato un po' di tempo a esplorare la piattaforma, mi sono subito reso conto di quanto fosse facile da usare. L'interfaccia era pulita e intuitiva e sono stato in grado di personalizzare facilmente la piattaforma per adattarla alle esigenze specifiche della mia attività.Freshdesk mi ha permesso di impostare l'assegnazione automatica dei biglietti e le notifiche e-mail, il che mi ha permesso di risparmiare una notevole quantità di tempo e di rispondere più rapidamente alle richieste dei clienti. Inoltre, l'app mobile mi ha permesso di gestire facilmente i miei ticket di assistenza mentre ero in movimento. Ho anche apprezzato i report dettagliati e le analisi in Freshdesk. Questi strumenti mi hanno aiutato a tenere traccia delle mie prestazioni e a prendere decisioni basate sui dati per migliorare il mio servizio clienti.",1
"Overall experience using Zendesk suite is positive as it's integration , customizable solutions, powerful reporting capabilities are very helpful to streamlined customer support process",1
It has been very useful so far to integrate multiple brands but still allowing us to use the same customer service team.,1
It helped us organize our interractions with our customers,1
"Overall we are very happy with ServiceNow and use it on daily basis for incident management, Change management and IT helpdesk operations.",1
It has been great. I was looking for a very simple tool to deal with IT issues without having to clog up my Outlook inbox and this has been fantastic. At a low price point I'm able to have all my tickets in a system that shows me all the notes between I and the staff and an easy to read email sent out automatically when I respond in the system itself.,1
"Pros:The software is pretty easy to implement, a bit intuitive. It require a bit of practice, but the same applies to all the other software. The issue management system is also pretty good.",1
"Pros:It is a tool designed to work well within an Atlassian ecosystem. If your development staff is already using Jira, the integration within the tools is great.",1
It seems like it might work for our business we did not have enough time to set up the page to see if it works to how we like it. they should make the free version free until it starts being used. I really only had enough time to see how it worked but not actually test it internally.,1
Using Customer service management module and the solid platform has the biggest value.,1
"I no longer use this desk.It has a huge learning curve, especially if you're used to Zendesk or Freshdesk.Of course, it's ok once you finally get the gist of it down, but I rely on analytics to be accurate always.I do really like Zoho Invoice.That is easy to use and it gives you a discounted PayPal fee when you are paid via PayPal.",0
Pros:It has a lot of features and has been around for ages,1
"Would reccomend,A++",1
"Zendesk has effectively streamlined out ticketing process, and continues to be a powerful tool for my organization.",1
"Pros:Zendesk does a great job at constantly improving their product, listening to their customers, and releasing new features to make their customers job's easier and better. From their basic ticketing support, to live chat, talk, and even guides, they really have it all under one roof. They have good tutorials and a pretty active community to get help from if you need it.",1
The overall experience has been exceptional.The team is very happy to use it. Their knowledge base and CRM features are very useful. We dont feel that we will shift to any other service in the coming years,1

"Finally, I found an integrated technical support system.",1
Tracking all the Tickets without missing out anything,1
Pros:The ability to type my requests & inquiries instead of having to call or waste a lot of (otherwise valuable) time!,1
Pros:Its a great software to track and maintain all of company's inventory in the centralized manner.,1
"Pros:The fact that the staff does not have to enter anything in particular as all info is prepolulated. In fact, this is so far the best we have tested and we did test a lot!!!",1
"Pros:I used this system in my previous role at access, as a sales development rep. We used it to facilitate our website live chat, mainly to attract leads but also to direct support queries to the right place. It works well for the job, notifies when a chat comes in and rarely if ever crashes during a chat",1
Pros:A great tool to organize oneself and the company.,1
Streamlining of Sales and Customer Service departments to ensure our Clients are happier.,1
"We love the flow of the program, it allows us to track the customers issue s from start to finish, and help us see how we can get better response times to our clients",1
Pros:Outil efficace.Bonnes fonctionnalités (moins bien interconnecté que d'autres),0
Freshdesk has been phenomenal in my daily workflow to help me reach my customers.,1
"We have been using zendesk for our customer management service for our products and it seems going well for past 6 months.You pay per agent. It provides a widget system to implement on your website to easily capture any customer issue directly visited from site and email system is another good side of zendesk which we found very professionally managed with integration with several third-party apps. Also, it provides multi-device support and mobile, which is a handy tool if you are on the run.",1
"Pros:I was part of the team who was setting up Service now Helpdesk for IT team. It surely decreased the distance between the IT Team and employees, Ticketing system is very streamlined and escalation management is also good. Best part is that setting up Service now is very straightforward and there is not much hassle.",1
Without Freshdesk we would have to provide support totally through email. With multiple agents in different time zones it would be a nightmare not to have a ticketing system. Please we can keep track with unresolved issues so our customer's can rest assured we have not forgotten about them.,1
Pros:Robust platform that pretty much started email ticketing as we know it today. Mostly fully featured software with a complete Knowledge Base database.,1
"I know the say 40,000 customers, but I question how many are happy.We're small, we manage under 10 websites that need unique customer service emails.We have a few agents, some need to see all sites, others just 1.We just wanted basic email tickets from inbound email, assign to the right person, reply, all syncs up... not too much to ask.We're about 4 months in, and its been a pretty horrible experience.While customer service does answer the phone at Zen, getting the same answer twice is rare.You basically need a PHD in Zen and very few, even at the company have it.I suppose a large company pays them to do it or has a dedicated IT Zen guy on it and gets his own PHD in Zendesk.But we're small (under $10M).I gave it 2 stars, as the staff is very nice, and eager to help.And they do claim they can do it.We're pretty savvy, and figure most things out.Zen got close, but really, they're not for the small company like us.I didn't like that they bait and switched us with free live chat, and 2 weeks after, they asked us to pay for it?odd.We were thinking of using the phone system, but I can't review that as we couldn't even get the email ticket system to work, so I just don't trust it.We lost thousands in sales with lost tickets.At one point, they had marked days of emails all as spam that were legitimate emails.",0
Pros:It has all features required for supporting our customers. The Mobile app is perfect and easy to use.,1
Pros:We use JSD for a IT Helpdesk ticketing system involving a wide variety of workflows.These workflows are easy to create and manage.Using the actual workflows is easy the UI making it really easy to follow.,1
Pros:It literally keeps track of everything.And we have the ability to add in more parameters.As well as take away parameters if no longer needed.,1
"Pros:- Simple Setup- Professional Interface- Useful features- Fun to useI've used a number of on-premise solutions in the past, including ManageEngine.The search features and simplicity of use is a welcome improvement with Zoho.",1
"Pros:We use zoho for a variety of tech needs, service is always quick and friendly with a desire to help out as much as needed.",1
"Pros:One of the things I like most about Zendesk Suite is its ability to centralize and streamline customer service operations. Zendesk Suite offers a wide range of features such as helpdesk ticketing, live chat, phone support, self-service portals, and more, which allows businesses to manage customer interactions across multiple channels. This makes it easy for businesses to provide fast, efficient and personal customer service, which can be particularly important for businesses that rely on customer loyalty",1
We use it for our tech support team as well as other teams in IT.It is super easy to use and easy to customize fields that you need.We are able to keep track of tickets and can assign tickets to other departments to assist.The ability to forward tickets to non-users makes it easy to keep up with all open tickets in one location.,1
Pros:I love that it has a two-way integration with ZOHO CRM,0
"Pros:Ease of use, customer service, brand modifications",1
"Good product, and price value.It's flexible with all the integrations to scale as we grow.",1
"Freshdesk is a helpdesk platform that runs in the cloud and provides strong customer service solutions. Freshdesk streamlines communication across platforms by combining conversations from email, phone, online, chat, and social media. Freshdesk will manage SLAs, provide accessible self-service choices, automate workflows, and generate reports using Freshdesk. Over 50,000 businesses, including Bridgestone, HP, Harvard University, and DHL, use Freshdesk.",1
............,1
"I would say so soYes, it is a great customer support ticket platform and it allows a lot of customization, however that can be quite overwhelming and requires a lot of reading and digging into things to figure out how stuff works.So it is definitely not as easy to use as others that are just self-explanatory.Now the pricing structure is super super confusing and the most annoying is that they seem to just change the prices and remove features from the plan without notifications.Suddenly our ability to use the FB chat integration was gone and only after countless messages forth and back with Zendesk support they told us that this feature is not available in our plan anymore and that we should upgrade.Zendesk just changed their plan names and now charges double....So within 2 years of using it we should already pay double the price for the same services, does not make sense.",1
"Pros:Lots of features, and decently straight forward to use. The front end is pretty intuitive but the behind the scenes functionality is not so straight forward.",1
Freshdesk has been great.We are able to effectively manage support tickets from over 100 companies with just a few support personnel.,1
We like this application suit and module workflows and interfaces are quite easy to use. We've found these pleasant to view and user friendly.,1
"Pros:I personally find User Interface (Mint version) is very clean and amiable:It helps when the UI is refined down to the essentials - what functions I use most, and the places I need to go, are often no more than 1 or 2 clicks away, which is always appreciated. A clean, sharp UI helps save time and removes distractions helping to maintain focus on the task at hand.The aesthetics for the Mint UI is also very amiable, making use of a simple/soft colour tone - I use Freshdesk daily, so it really helps to find what I look at pleasing.",1
"As a user loved it. But on the backend side, I'm not so sure. When it worked, it worked. But when it didn't, it seems like that's when it went off the rails.",1
"Zoho Desk can be used by companies of all sizes to provide a comprehensive and efficient help desk solution. It can be used to create tickets and manage customer requests, store and share knowledge, set up automated workflows, generate reports, and more.",1
Overall experience has been good. We primarily use ZenDesk Support and it provides us all the required capabilities.,1
Customer support and for the free version is very useful and complete tool. Make's me buy a full version.,1
It helps us to administer our support tickets and create FAQ articles for them.,1
"Pros:Freshdesk is an excellent service that allows you to take your business to a higher level, it is marketing, but what I like the most is its way of joining new technologies with new ones, since it takes care of your customers both by phone and mail, as by social networks, thus joining the two types of customers, those of the old and the new school, also giving the ability of interactivity to the clients within the application, allowing them to create entries among other things, it is very complete and functional.",1
"I love this platform for project management and I strongly recommend it to all project managers, web managers, especially if you are working with vendors/teams outside of your organization. I've used JIRA for years and it's been one of the best platforms in my experience.",1
Pros:mi è piaciuto il fatto che consente di organizzare le diverse task coinvolgendo tutte le funzioni,1
I did not like this CRM at all. It is very clumsy and I do not find it suitable for a dynamic customer support environment.,1
great product the remove the need of manual interaction and automate the entire product lifecycle including the product support,1
"We havent integrated it yet, still trying to see if it fits our needs.",1
I use JIRA to document my support tickets and project tasks.,1
Pros:This system allows me to communicate with my customers and answers their queries without delay which is gold dust when it comes to customer service.,1
"Pros:Customization is good, we can set custom rules, scalability and integration. Its meeting our basic needs of IT ticketing system and helping to manage all the task along with solutions.",1
"Excelent, in over 7 years of use we have never had a service disruption. It satisfies our needs",1
We have been using Freshdesk for a little over 6 months now. We move from a chat based support to a full blown ticket based support software because we wanted to cautiously document and track bugs and customer feedback and plug it back into our product development roadmap. We have been able to accomplish that and more with Freshdesk.,1
"Overall, can't imagine using a different software in replacement of Zoho Desk. It gives everything I need for work.",1
"Our experience with Zendesk Suite has been extremely positive. The software is intuitive and easy to use, making it simple for our team to efficiently handle customer inquiries and concerns. The Ticket Management feature, in particular, has been incredibly impactful, allowing our team to prioritize and organize customer inquiries in a way that maximizes efficiency and effectiveness.The Sales Pipeline Management feature has also been a valuable asset, as it helps our team stay on top of potential sales opportunities and effectively manage and close deals. The Multi-Channel Communication feature is also a standout, as it enables our team to communicate with customers through a variety of channels, providing convenience and flexibility.Integration with other applications and services has been seamless, allowing our team to easily access and utilize the information and tools they need to provide the best possible customer support. The reporting and analytics feature provides valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences, allowing us to make data-driven decisions.Zendesk Suite has been a valuable asset to our company, helping us to improve our customer support and resulting in a positive customer experience. It's also worth noting that Zendesk Suite's customer support is top-notch, they are always available to assist and answer any questions, and they constantly release updates to improve the software.",1
Pros:We are many supporters using it everyday at the same time and it's still running just fine. It's not data consuming. I even manage to use on a very low internet speed.,1
Helped keep Helpdesk communication organized which made happier customers.,1
Better than most tools I've used during my experience as support technician.,1
Our customers are happy and informed with Freshdesk while the support & customer success teams have become much more efficient after we implemented this tool.,1
It was more of a help than a headache.,1
Pros:Zendesk help u to become available 24/7 for ur customer's and help u track each and every open and closed customer qwery in the form of ticket's,1
"Zendesk customer support is fantastic, as you would expect from a CRM company.",1
Overall I've been very satisfied with Zendesk and look forward to seeing what they come out with next.,1
"Pros:Zendesk makes finding, organizing, and replying to customer support tickets incredibly easy, so you can focus on helping your customer instead of figuring out your support tool. The many filtering options sort conversations into different teams, and you can easily search for a specific ticket or customer. One of the best features is the ability to mute the customer conversation, so you can share information with other support staff before responding publically.",1
"My experience surf Zendesk has been nothing but great, I feel supported and I can trust the customer service!",1
The way we can centralize everything on it is real a benefit.,1
"Pros:We use this software for technical support questions, chat and overall support to our customers. It is very convenient, I even use the app.",1
"Client's problem solving, service desk functionality usage, see who are ticket solvers, who does more work etc",1
"Pros:Allows my company's IT team to track service tickets for computer issues, gives the user updated data on where their ticket is at and allows them to ping to see where it's at on the list of things to do",1
"Personally, this was the best platform that ever happened to our team. We reviewed some pay-for feature models, as well as the free bug tracker in Spiceworks (which had a ton of adware), and Freshdesk was the simplest to use and track our bugs even with the non-ability to drill down further with the tier we were using for our staff. The only other thing I would mention, is that it is not HIPAA compliant, so you want to make sure anything users are posting in there is not anything related to proprietary software. Otherwise it worked like a charm for our team, and our users seemed to like it. You do need to make sure that your teams using it have their emails alerting them, otherwise a ticket can just sit there. I found that I was reminding folks to check the freshdesk--from an IT standpoint, we were in there every day fielding tickets and this really helped us to schedule out our day/week and prioritize.",1
"Overall ease of access is 8 on 10 with regards to data management, agent management and automation for automatic ticket assignment, could improve the auto-assignment if the concurrency setting is provided",1
"I usually used it for medium complex projects with 8-12 number of users, I can say that jira increased my productivity.",1
Overall it is a good platform for ticket management and basic and advanced support.,1
"excellent.I recently had the pleasure of using Zoho Desk, the customer service and helpdesk software. I found that the software was very intuitive and easy to use, with a well laid out dashboard that made navigation effortless. The various features, like ticketing system, knowledge base and customer self-service portal make managing customer data simpler. Furthermore, I found that I could customize the software easily, setting up automated workflows and add-ons to better suit my specific needs.",1
"Pros:We use zendesk to help manage and track information regarding our inbound client interactions. This tool also allows us to track progress on different audits and reviews done by other teams, that affect our clients. Our client success team can then communicate any updates/information to our clients to provide a great customer service experience.",1
"Zendesk is easy to use, straight-forward and efficient.",1
"This was the first software help desk solution that we didn't have to spend a long period of time configuring to get it working how we needed it to. Out of other options we had tried at the time when undertaking our research, most had to have scripted or difficult configs to make it our go to platform.",1
"Zendesk elminates the problem of accidentally missing a chat request or responding to that chat request in a delayed manner, We route the chat messages to different people throughout the different times of the day, on all their devices, and they can respond even if they are on the road. This is particularly important for sales questions and getting them responded by sales people. We keep all chat history in our CRM, we can customize the chat windows as we want - nothing more to want really!",1
"As a leader of a remote insurance telesales team, I run into my fair share of IT related issues to work through with my agents. I also run into system errors of my own to find solutions for. When I am unable to troubleshoot on my own or for my team, directing them to submit an IT ticket using the simple system with Zendesk makes my life (and theirs) so much easier. I use this application daily and have never run into an issue, nor has my team.",1
"Out of all the solutions we explored Freshdesk was our #1 choice for help desk services,and after 2 years, we stand by our decision.",1
Freshdesk makes it easy to correspond with our clients and makes it easy for them to reach out to us. Our company has integrated Freshdesk with other programs that we use so that we get updates for when clients have responded to us on tickets. This is great since it makes sure that we never miss when a client has responded to us.,1
Can help us make our work more Effective and a reliable program.,1
Manage our entire Service Desk unit.,1
Pros:The software has all the features to keep a project running. Creating and assigning tickets to keep track of activities is user friendly.,1
"Using Zendesk, our customer care representatives are able to obtain the information they need on their own. When I handle the articles, I hear nothing but good things about how this program makes my job easier and more productive. They may use slack to look for answers, and the results will be linked to relevant articles in Zendesk. Zendesk may be easily integrated with other services, such as slack.",1
"Pros:Email request ability, ability to receive HipChat notifications, and ability to create customize reports.",1
"Experience an automated support, self-service management and professional customization.",1
Pros:Been evaluating the product and it does pretty much everything that we were looking in a helpdesk. I am not aware of the downtimes mentioned here.,1
it really helped me to set up my customer service team without too much hustle.I love the product.,1
It was a good choice and I recommend Freshdesk if anyone is looking for Omnichannel solution with affordable price plans,1
Pros:I have used Zendesk for over 6 years to manage customer support and FAQ for a start up and it has grown with us I’ve the years and been very beneficial,1

Pros:This software has greatly improved the turnaround times and production times with on the department,1
"I have been using JIRA and its different versions, distributions, add-ons for a time now.This is one of the best-known yet expensive solution for ticketing, and one of the best working one.You may check what points I have collected for pros and cons, yet if I could, I would use and recommend JIRA.The interface what most people ragging about JIRA, indeed needs to time to get familiar with, but Salesforce and its chatter, JIRA is still better.There are training material, some on-boarding also available in-built for JIRA and after a few ticket, you are ready to go on your own.In every sector you can find ticketing tools, JIRA is customizable according to your needs.If a lot of people are going to use it, I recommend to have an on-premise solution with a lot of power.There are rivals to JIRA, even in-house ticketing tools, in my company now we have 2 systems, yet an IT-provider can use a lot of them, causing a chaos.JIRA is continuously being developed, there are 3rd party extensions to it, quite stable.",1
"Overall, this was a great management platform. We discontinued because it did not have an upsell feature and wasn't very friendly to multiple users. I'd say it's perfect for a start up with with only one or two agents.",1
Like a breath of fresh air!!,1
"Pros:Jira Serice Desk is very similar to other B2B2 ticketing websites where a clients or inner organizations can open a support ticket to get an issue resolved. I like just a fewthingsfrom Jira which are; its easy to use the UI is very simple to use and navigate through the JIRA service desk web based ticketing system, the ability to track changes in the tickets, make comments either internally or externally, customize the ticket the way i want it to show, either by department, or group or an individual, its subscription basedso there is no need of backing up, securing, or changing hardware.",1
Pros:I love the ability to start on the free package (which is very powerful) and grow into more complex and chargeable services.,1
"Pros:The cost of the product is extremely competitive, the product itself is easy to use, easy to configure and customize.",1
"Minha experiência geral com o Freshdesk foi muito positiva. A plataforma oferece uma ampla gama de recursos e ferramentas para gerenciamento de suporte ao cliente, tornando-o um dos melhores sistemas de helpdesk disponíveis atualmente.",0
"Pros:Freshdesk Mint:-Excellent layout, routing process, prioritization, and reporting-Extensive filtration options to revisit old topics-We're currently offering 57 independent knowledge-bases to our clients, so this has been a leg up in offering custom, quality, self-service",1
"We are answering customer tickets and delegating them to various team members, but the service is not worth the exorbitant price we have been paying for it.",0
"Apart from the fact that Zendesk provides centralized support and data for general enquiries, it facilitates a powerful reporting of customer satisfaction surveys. Zendesk software incorporates a large number of Apps such as Mailchimp, Shopify, Xero and others.It also creates an infused knowledge base for users and customers alike.",1
"Pros:Centralised support, income and frequent enquiriesAbility to create policies to routinely file requests and emails into organizations or departments based totally on a variety of valuesCreate a branded expertise base for staff, customers and customersIntegrates with a massive wide variety of apps, such as MailChimp, Trustpilot, Shopify, WooCommerce, Xero and many different solutionsPowerful reporting and consumer pleasure surveysEliminates the want for emails and effortless to filter me",1
"I was able to integrate the tool within my app easily, it exceeded my expectations, it works very well. The customer service is very well organized.",1
Good! It’s a clear and helpful way to track work and keep things organized. Way better than trying to deal with support requests through email,1
"Freshdesk has allowed us to provide a pleasant customer service channel to answer questions or report any inconvenience our service may have suffered. We are satisfied with this platform, since we have managed to solve more efficiently and quickly, which has generated praise with our clients.",1

Handling of issuesVisibility of issuesService Desk reportingChange Request management and identifying the priorities in developments,1
Les problème qui nous permet de résoudre sont beaucoup mais la manière dont l'offre des tickets est faite est bonne,1
Extremely simple to set up and begin using immediately. The agents are really enthusiastic about it and have accepted it quickly. Super user-friendly and packed with options. Excellent for plugging into preexisting infrastructure and developing bespoke APIs.,1
Great for business,1
"Pros:I love the functionality and that you are able to curate canned responses to be applied. This makes responding to customers 10 times easier and a most faster process. I also appreciate that I am able to track the email I just sent as well, for notation purposes.",1
Unfailingly courteous even when dealing with a difficult person or situation.,1
"Pros:1) We mainly used this tool to plan our tasks for the projects we were working on.2) Creating Sprint Cycles and assigning tickets for each issue is very convenient using JIRA3) We can see the progress made by the ticket owner in the ticket description.4) There is a very brief and concise Audit history which we can track to see how the ticket status has changed5) I like the customization feature for each team and each product. We can choose what statuses and workflow our ticket should go through and select and arrange them very quickly.6) We can even link the BitBucket repo link and confluence link with our JIRA ticket, which is very handy for developers.",1
"I was a very happy user of Jira on the whole, and I am certainly missing it now that I have moved onto another product. I felt that it allowed many users to be involved in the issues raised, which kept all of the discussion in one central location, rather then firing off in email chains that it's easy to be omitted from.",1
"I had the opportunity to use the OTRS ticket system and would like to share my experience. Overall, the use of the system was positive, but there were also some aspects that, in my opinion, could be improved.The user interface is well-designed and significantly facilitates ticket management. The ability to integrate plugins enhances functionality and allows for customization to meet specific requirements.Unfortunately, I encountered challenges regarding adaptability. It was not as flexible as I would have liked, and options for layout customization could be improved. Better customization options would enhance user-friendliness.Overall, I rate the OTRS ticket system with a score of 5/10. It provides solid core features, but limitations in adaptability and the need for layout improvements impact the overall experience. I hope that future updates will address these aspects and further optimize the system's performance.",1
Pros:Easy to useReally good and helpful support available at anytime. Even during night shifts in case something goes wrong they are able to provide chat support.,1
Pros:Scalability.Flexibility to be tailored to particular organizational needs.Very rich in terms of features.,1
"Pros:This makes it very easy and convenient for us to work with all customers, vendors, new customers, sponsorships, warranties, general technical inquiries and beyond.

We would be held back.",1

Pros:It is easy to set up an environment in which you can collect all the company requests for IT and not only that.,1
Support is awesome and try to mimic every scenario that you haveto fix your problem.Certain features lac the ability to integrate it with other third party ticketing system.Its good for small-medium level enterprises and fulfills all the basic requirement of ticketing system.,1
"Pros:Pour une fois, rien à redire : intuitif, la base de données permets de trouver une réponse rapidement pour les plaintes clients, rapide, fluide, on est dans la modif à la seconde avec les notifications qui permettent de ne pas perdre de temps....",1
I think it's absolutely fantastic.bI wonder about the training process and how every person responding to a support ticket knows so much about my issue and how to resolve it for every company I have delt with. How do they know???,1

Pros:The pricing is not very expensive compared to other held desk software. You also get some free lite agents who can put private notes.,1
"Freshdesk is a good product.Their technical support is sporadic.Sometimes goodsometimes bad. Unfortunately, it is on the downturn again. When I first started, I had to wait days for a support question to be answered, and to contact a salesperson was almost impossible.Their phone support is unusable.It rings forever, and when you do get through since it is impossible to get throughthough you cannot hear them.The times I have gotten through and left a message, noone has replied to my question.When your a single person business this is frustrating,The support became better and now it is going back downhill again.I feel I have to convince them that something is wrong.What is most bothersome is they don't understand as a single person business I cannot spend days on a problem, and if I tell them there is an issue such as an attack on an email address, which I have no control over and they don't fix it.",1
"While Freshdesk has a great UI, and is a feature-rich service, the truth behind the advertising leaves much to be desired. While their software is good, the pricing model isn't, and their marketing is intentional bait-and-switch. The features listed on each pricing tier are expanded upon here: freshdesk.com/features. Once you buy, and ask what's up, the support will tell you to upgrade for that feature, and link you to a page that isn't linked to from anywhere on their site: freshdesk.com/helpdesk-features, as justification.As an example, $15/agent/month includes, SLA Management, which is described from their features page as including every SLA feature, including basic things like SLA email notifications, reminders, escalation policies. You know, what anyone would think of as SLA Management. However, none of those features are actually included in that price plan. To even get email notifications of SLA violations, or have your SLA respect office hours, you'll have to pay $50/agent/month. Worse, there is no way to discover this until after you've paid and spent time getting everything set up.",1
The versatility and adaptability of the system and the system has a server to manage incidents in an optimal manner,1
Very easy to navigate and configure for a non-technical administrator. The software is also very intuitive. The product allows you to grow with the demands of your business. Especially nice for a start up that just needs a place to start but can expandwithout having to start over with another CRM,1
"Pros:I remember when Zendesk first arrived on the scene, and I was in need of some helpdesk software for a new customer-facing project, so I decided to see what Zendesk was like. I was immediately impressed with how clean the UI was, and how at ease it made me feel when I viewed it as a user, while I was setting up the ticket types and options. I understood pretty much right away why it was called Zendesk. If you want a hassle-free ticketing system, look no further. Uncomplicated issue management at it's best.",1
Pros:The PPX system integration is very helpfull to make the information management more efficient making my team support more productive.,1
I would recommend JIRA as one of the best project Management tools to be used especially for Agile projects as it has everything you need to manage and track your project from the inception to the end delivery.,1
"Simple, affordable customer ticket management with SLA support and easy integration with development, IT teams through Jira and other Atlassian ecosystem tools.",1
"Für kleine Unternehmen, gut nutzbar, sobald die Organisation grösser wird, und die Strukturen komplexer, nicht zu empfehlen.Man konzentriert sich auf KI Features, die nicht funktionieren, und vernachlässigt die komplett dasBasisprodukt.",0
Overall it's a great software and helps make your job a little less stressful.,1

"Pros:It's setup is easy and allows you to cover many of the inquiries and questions your customers, have, without creating web pages you have to update.

It also provide accountability to inquiries so you can follow up and have a trail to make sure that the inquiry was addressed, and if not you can fix it.",1

This was the first software used for Customer Support on the website and a stepping stone. Moved to Gorgias that works well with Shopify.,0

"Great to finally see such an integrated service desk, making it even easier for technical and non-technical teams to use JIRA for what it was designed for, and more. It's clean, easy to install and administer, and integrate with not only JIRA, but also Confluence. Atlassian continues to impress!",1
"The entire company uses Zoho Desk to manage our daily processes and report on our projects. We track our daily records with all the basic modules such as Contacts, Accounts and Transactions. We have customized most of these modules to better reflect our own internal processes, as this is easy to do in Zoho Desk. The built-in reporting features allow us to easily customize reports the way we want, giving us excellent business insights.",1
"Very flexible. But... It takes a lot to configure. It would be nice if there was a way to close a Service Desk or choose a template.Right now, for each new service desk we do the following:* Remove all Service Types* Add our own Service Types* Add appropriate fields to each Service Type* Update Service Request Security* Add customers",1

We track how quickly and how the customer experience was with out customer service group.,1

This days zendesk its almost an standar software for helpdesk. Was easy to configure and start using it by the IT people. Has all the options that you need to give support to the computers on a large network.,1
We used Zendesk at 3 of my last 4 jobs. The last 2 at my suggestion. We handle a diverse amount of different customer issues and its a great system to manage and track all the different interactions our customers are having as well as the agents that are handling them.,1
"Freshdesk helps us a lot to manage our customer interactions effectively and efficiently. It's the lead capture and scoring capabilities, the email tracking functionality works really well. I switch to another product, but if they bring some advanced features like predictive analytics, I will definitely use it again.",1
"Mi permette una gestione a 360° dei miei strumenti di lavoro soliti che mi facilita di gran lunga il lavoro , dandomi la possibilità di personalizzare il tutto secondo le mie esigenze senza stravolgere troppo le mie abitudini",1

It's the right amount of data to understand the health of your chat support.",1
Pros:The Desk is more useful tool.Our customers are able to submmit the tickets on the go and it is very easy to agent to assess the customer.,1
"I used ServiceNow daily, almost hourly to be honest, as a Level 2 Desktop Support Agent. It replaced vFire which was getting slow and agonizing to work with. Tickets would come in and we would perform the work and move the ticket along and/or close it altogether depending on the job. I liked using it and felt it was very robust and powerful while still being nimble and problem free.",1
It helps us easily track our client issues and easily view them,1
The types of business problems we are solving are as follows:Quicker support for our clients,1
Being able to quickly and efficiently organize client emails and responses. I am able to prioritize who to contact when helping a client with an inquiry. I am also able to quickly respond to clients using the handy maco tools and canned emails.,1
"Zoho Desk is very responsive and fast, is packed with useful features and easy to use for everybody.",1
I think this tool is great and the company itself does a great job of being transparent and supporting their own clients. They set the bar for good customer service and are enabled by their own app.,1
If one owns a small company this is the right software for him and we should always go with this,1
"It is a great product, but still lots of improvements needs to be made",1
"Pros:The native integration with JIRA software management and business management project boards make ticket triaging and documentation straightforward and low effort.

Good Tool for project management,1
"Pros:I'd have to say that I like the sync between their CRM and the help desk and the way in which they handle the ticketing process, its very smooth and yet still powerful.",1
"Zendesk feels user- and customer friendly, you profit from an accessible knowledge base but for a growing SaaS company we feel like there could be improvement in supporting more extensive workflows, processes and ITSM-aspects.",1
"I like it and we will stick with using this product. From all the other ticketing systems, advanced or basic, that I have used before, this is the nicest of all. It is ideal for startups or smaller companies in my opinion, but it has advanced features and integration capabilities which are interesting to bigger enterprises as well. I also like their customer support, they are very prompt, they really want to help and are not just passing things around.",1
Overall great experience. Integrations are fantastic. So far have never had a need to speak to customer service but I assume its great too.,1
"Pros:It has vast features for Enterprise management, it is one stop platform for tracking and maintaining all the data in one location.",1
"Pros:- Real data easy to update and retrieve even after a long time since the case was closed- Very clear dashboards, easy to read and visualise performance data- Queue system easy to implement even in big organisations with complex segmented workflows",1
Freshdesk is critical to our customer communications and agent accountability. Timing is critical to our business and Freshdesk helps us keep up with a high volume of quality customer communications as a small but mighty team.

The ability to connect with customers who want to use chat.Who doesn't want to use chat.,1
"Customer queries used to be managed in Excel. Still, it was time-consuming to track history and the status of responses could not be managed, resulting in cases where there were omissions in responses. However, with the introduction of Zendesk, it is possible to aggregate by tags and monitor trends easily. Since it is possible to manage match/no match status, there are no match omissions.",1
"Zoho Desk is a top-tier platform for developing individualized customer service offerings. It's a separate platform connected to the company that has all the greatest capabilities for prioritizing requests, managing the requests, and closing more and more requests. I've been using Zoho Desk for quite some time now, and it's been invaluable for streamlining my operations and those of my customer service staff.",1
"Pros:Zendesk is a feature rich CRM suite that scales effortlessly as your startup grows. The whole suite is available for free for one year for all qualified startups. Whether it's live chat or ticket management or knowledge management, Zendesk has a solution that simply works out of the box. Zendesk also provides integrations with social media accounts which means users can reach out over Twitter/Instagram and get resolution for their issues instantly.",1
Zendesk is a great tracking tool for handling all kinds of issue tickets from customer issues to internal IT issues. It's been a lifesaver for being able to keep track of all client issues in one place.,1
"My experience with JIRA Service Management was positive. The platform provided a comprehensive solution for managing and resolving customer requests and incidents. The ticketing system, along with its customizable workflows, allowed us to streamline our support processes and ensure timely resolution of issues. The integration with other Atlassian products, such as JIRA Software and Confluence, facilitated collaboration between different teams and improved overall productivity. The reporting and analytics capabilities helped us gain insights into our support team's performance and make data-driven decisions. Although there was a learning curve during the initial setup, the benefits of JIRA Service Management in terms of efficiency, collaboration, and customer satisfaction made it a valuable tool for our organization.",1

"Pros:It helps to track all the issues faced by a specific customer and helps a brand improve its services. It is easy to set up and use. You can also interact with customers through the site. They provide quick customer service and support. They keep adding new features. Also, it ensures educational training to use the program better. It enables user access to the knowledge base, and monitor or edit all the tickets. It integrates with many other platforms like Facebook, email, Dropbox, Google work etc. Provides encryption and back up of data.",1
We got convenient for clients Helpdesk portalBut still we are upset about lack of customizations and that some features are hardcoded (e.g. translations of Feedback form),1
"Positive experience, I've used it in all of my development roles",1
Overall very positive and I would recommend it.,1
"Overall, Zendesk Suite is a powerful and comprehensive customer support solution that offers a range of valuable features and benefits.

Customer tickets managements,0
"Freshdesk has improved customer communication and helpdesk support, especially as a ticket tracking solution. Email integration for virtual help desk. Freshdesk simplifies task distribution and helps us gauge client happiness.",1

Si dudas, es una app que la recomiendo 100 x 100.",1
I give it the highest rate when it comes to all dimension above and whats not mention above I was in a different level before I start using the whole desk so I’m highly recommending it to others and I really can count on it,1
Pros:I like how easy and accessible zendesk is. Zendesk has many options to stay organized and track your work.,1
"Pros:I love that it is an efficient helpdesk system - very easy to use, respond to queries, and monitor progress of complaints. Running a small business means you are in a critical stage of building your customer pool and making sure that you provide excellent customer support- that's what Zendesk is all about. Making sure that you're on track and nothing falls through the cracks!",1
"Counting days till our subscription expires, after that there is no chance in hell I would proceed with the software.TERRIBLE customer support, who does not give a single damn about Level 1 - Crirical problems.We've switched our subscription to monthly billing, and they were happy to charge a monthly fee. However, right after that they attempted to charge our subscription (the same one) with an annual payment we used to have before the change. I mean, it's ok, there are issues in software an all, BUT. I've reported the issue to them and very quickly got an answerI'm going to go ahead and send this ticket over to our Finance Ops team. Someone from their team will be reaching out soon!Five business days passed, I reached out to them four times, they promised to escalate the issue and guess what? They attempted to charge the card for the annual payment for the third time, no answer to my ticket meantime.So the overall impression is – run from Zendesk as fast as you can, luckily, there are a plethora of similar solutions out there.",0
"Pros:Ease of integration with a form solution (Zoho Form), has an app for ease on the go, and the helpdesk is easy to use customise.",1
"Pros:Simple to setup, use and administer the system. Our agents enjoy using Zendesk and it doesn't take long for them to figure things out. The support is good and I've never had a problem resolving issues. We use Zendesk Voice which is a nice product.",1
"Have been using it for more than 2 years now. Now that I have learned the admin panel entirely, I can do pretty much everything. The main thing which makes this product stand out is the wide range of features and the simplicity to implement them. (e.g. SSO).",1
"Pros:The processing of a ticket is a really fast process, and has the main features required to provide customers support.",1
Pros:How easy it is to useHow much it helps the operations in the businessHow much time it savesHow it keeps a rating of customer satisfaction,1
Has saved us lots of time and I also feel it gives a more professional feel to our service.,1

"Pros:Using Markdown and some Zendesk Fu you can easily update ticket status from your inbox. Zendesk makes it easy to customise with ticket fields, categories, tags to personalise support for customers",1
I enjoyed Service Now and believe it's the best ticketing system tool out there.,1
All in one solution for the company. We have previously had seperate software.,1
"Overall our customer service response time has improved tremendously. Customers are happy with quick responses. We don't always have the answers they are looking for when we get back to them, but we want to at least respond letting them know that we're handling it.",1
"I am a customer of this brand since several years. About 2 weeks before the expiration of the annual subscription, due to Covid-19 I asked Freshdesk to put my subscription on hold for a while.They replied that they do not have such a feature. I asked what could I do, in order to pause their services. They just replied about the same day when the subscription ended to suggest me that I should export all my contacts. When I tried to do that, the subscription expired already and the export feature was deactivated. I sent a few email since, hoping for a reply: nobody replied, so this should mean that either I pay the renwal or I lose my contacts. Not bad for a long term loyal customer to be treated this way!",0
"Overall Freshdesk, has been a positive experience for us as an organisation.Compared to other offerings there is nothing which would change our decision to use it. Would recommend.",1
Great!,1
My overall experience is Good. I have been using it now for more than a year and haven't face the need to use some other software.,1
"Simple to use in all departments. The SLA monitoring system and client communication tracking features of Freshdesk are excellent. It is simple to launch, explore through, and edit.",1
"Since we have been trailing the paid version of the helpdesk we have found some very good features, I do like the way the reporting looks and the ability toexport the reports, one downside is that when you change the report filters then you are unable to export, another problem I find is when I have completed a ticket and closed it sometimes I have to press the back button several times to get back to the open tickets.",0
"We've used Freshdesk for about year for all our help desk tickets.It works great for our small team of one Tech Support guy and one Marketing guy.For our size team, the product is free (compared to other products that wanted $50 - $200 / month for the same features).",1
Easy interface with the customers.,1
"Pros:i'm just a few days in to using this software, a fantastically flexible piece of software scalable to fit individual needs. even the limited (not so much that it'll stop you working) free edition is feature rich and will improve your companies support dept no end.",1
"Pros:amazing to manage your company from it, immediately emails for tickets, havinga mobile app which helpful forusing",0
"Overall, I am quite happy as a user when it comes to Freshdesk. It is easy to grasp, and it notifies you promptly when new tasks are popping up. The Call Centre function is very reliable and easy to use, especially since the phone app is well maintained, meaning no calls are missed. It is very easy to log cases and to also search for said cases.",1
Overall zendesk is great helpdesk and provide multiple features that an enterprise need to handle huge customer base and track tickets and complaints on the go. They should think of support system in mobile app too. Also I am not much satisfied with their customer support as they couldn't resolve many of the issues like reviving a lost ticket forms due to mistakenly closed issues.,1
"Gets the job done, but often frustrating",0
Overall a good experience . Used on a daily basis for managing technical support tickets.,1
"In general, Zendesk suite is a great option for companies wishing to enhance their customer support processes.",1

Zendesk is very easy to use. Really good for the business! I can recommend this software to all customer service businesses.,1
"Service Desk has good potentialities, it is very easy to set-up and use.There is still room to improve in its features.Still something to do regarding management of custom fields in the SD screens and SLA functionality.",0

Easy to use interface, highly customisable, with great plugins.Excellent and honest feedback direct from Zendesk as soon as a potential platform-wide issue is detected, with fast resolution to these problems.",1
It is a must have product as per my point of view to develop a growth and manage your tasks,1
Overall a good platform to start out with but may not be for those who require more advanced capabilities.,1
Business - customer relations. We are able to amass a great wealth of product and customer feedback that we can reference in the future as needed. This alone is quite valuable and makes wanting to change services a less attractive option for us.,1
Less pinging back an forth with customers to get all the information you need to help them. Easy to use form fields and form instructionsmake sure customers always fill out the right information from the start.No decisions made in endless email threads that then get lost. Communication is in context and visible to everyone involved.,1
Good tool for startup shops for ticketing system.I wouldn't recommend so much for large scale as the customizations can be difficult to maintain.,0
"If you own a business, you have to have Zendesk. It's an amazing platform for your respondance with your customers.",1
"I started as a free user and found it extremely versatile.My first hiccup was that, as a free user, when the advanced features that were included expired, they disabled my account.Instead of scaling it back it just went offline without warning.Once that was fixed we found an excellent way to continue with the free account until they implemented a spam update that invalidated all tickets sent to any email address except our main address.Again, this was done without warning and we were offline for 3 days.We have subscribed but it was done more out of necessity rather than being able to upgrade for full features.",1

"Pros:We've been zendesk chat for almost 3 years now without any issues.The free version itself gives most of the basic functionality. But if your service is vast, and requires multiple executives to attend to chat queries, the free version may be limiting. Zendesk is very easy to configure on your application and very intuitive.",1
We are a distribution company that imports several US and European brands into Canada.We manage the customer service inquiries for all these brands for Canadian customers and retailers.We were previously using Outlook inboxes but that became too cumbersome.Freshdesk has allowed us to feed all inquiries to one place while still maintaining our separate brands and automatically routing tickets to the appropriate customer services team.Our workflows are more efficient and customers are easier to track.,1

However, in the past few days, we encounter some problem that our costumer may not received emails from us even we already resolved and email them back up until now, not every time but sometimes, so I hope it you can fix it immediately. But again, my whole experience in Zendesk was superb.",1

Overall experience was too good but there are some issues that can be fixed.,1
Helped me in managing various activities,1
"Freshdesk in general is ok to work with, it doesn't excell in specific matters but also not fails. However we made the misstake to close our contract directly with Freshworks (as our re-seller stopped), this has been the biggest misstake ever. There customer service and assistance is not excisting, questions remain unanswered, no solutions are offered, with this all kind of problems start to arise for which no solutions are offered",0
"Pros:Zoho Desk, in comparison to its competitors, was very easy to setup and install. We were able to get this running across the organization in no time at all.ZohoDesk's user interface is very clean and simple, being able to manage and track tickets with ease. We've also had great feedback from the users who are reporting issues via Zoho Desk that the submission system is clear and easy to use.Being able to integrate with other systems, like Google Contacts, has been very useful. Something it's competitors just dont do.",1
"Pros:Call center option, multi-brand help center, Live chat support, Zoho bug tracker integration to name a few.",1
Pros:The best thing with zoho desk is how easy it is too use. The autocompletion and suggestions from the knowledge base is perfect for everyday use.,1
Overall we're happy with Freshdesk and have been using it for about five years now.,1
mainly a way to track ticketing. we are a free user at the moment but I can see us being a paid user shortly.,1
"I'm a satisfied user of Zendesk but I feel a lot of features are still missing and over time, I am not seeing any improvement with the platform. Our company may consider getting out of Zendesk in the next few years as Zendesk doesn't fit the analytics we need as our company grows.",1
"Once you get past the initial learning curve, it's a great app. Since we started using it, we have more control with our clients and all our tickets can be resolved.",1
Pros:The organizational features to handle your support tickets are second to none and can't be beat. Easy to use features for employees to easily submit tickets different ways.,1
Improved responsiveness of team to customer complaints,1
A good tool to communicate with the customers and also internal communication in Contact Center,1
"Makes work easier by having a good overview of ongoing tickets, but also past tickets, with details of what was built / done to offer a solution. That's dependant of what you enter into the system of course, but the options are there and they are clear.",1
The user experience with OTRS is amazing. Being able to show all your work to the client is great.,1
"JIRA Service Desk has allowed our internal support team to quickly manage issues raised by employees. When we deployed Service Desk, we had about 300 employees. Our company has more than doubled since then and we have continued to maintain our SLA with ease.We are in the process of migrating our Service Desk to server version 2.5.3. Our current cloud instance does not have Customer Portal capabilities; looking forward to the efficiency increases once we migrate to the latest and greatest.",1
Organized information for supporting my customer and having their information on hand for any situation that might arise.,1
Zendesk does so much more than expected. The chat and reports were so important for us to grow and manage every customer interaction.,1
"Pros:Very useful for companies to handle the support of their customers. If you establish good guidelines that everyone in your team can follow, it can really improve your handling time.",1
"It has solved some of our immediate business needs out-of-the-box or with moderate configuration effort. But as a full solution it is missing a handful of simple, but crucial, features. It definitely feels like a second version. It needs a third.",1
I love how the ticket submitting process is integrated into email so I can do it from anywhere that supports email. saves time and hassle.,1
Nice but not best just because of poor support.,1
Pros:Efficiency in managing service requests and streamlining communication.,1

Pros:Great tool for help desk it is easy to use and keep track of tickets.,1
"Pros:At some point we had too many mailboxes and too much email to properly track customer emails so we switched to Freshdesk and now we can stay on top of everything. We don't use it as a traditional ticketing system, we run all our email through it but it works. Canned responses are useful, alerts when 2 agents are working on an email at the same time, or if a response has just been sent while you were typing really help to avoid unintended miscommunication and using automations its possible to make up for any missing out of the box features (like snoozing an email).We use it every day. While I have some issues with it, we're basically running our business out of it so I'm pretty happy with it overall.",1
Good,1
"I use this to help monitor agent performance and occasionally track down support tickets for users. It is a wonderful tool. The agents seem to love the user interface, and our management uses the reporting features regularly.",1

Overall Zendesk is best for cloud customer support as it supports email updates to customers and it has also a customer view facility. It also helps to engage customers but there are also some cons of Zendesk as there is no customer support at all and its pricing is also too high,1
Pros:Quick responsive websiteConstance new features and integration 3rd partyHas mobile application,1
It's being used daily by our support team to track tickets coming from our customer - Best for B2B Setting,1
Pros:Integration with the rest of the solutions is pretty simple and prebuilt. API and hooks are very good for making connections to outside products.,1
Pros:The system is really easy to configure and any configuration changes are instantly available to end users.Zoho Desk has excellent integration with Zoho Reports providing clear visibility of the support desk and its performance.,1

"It really helps our team and empowers the customer to get the answer they're looking for before asking someone.That functionality then allows a lower number of calls and chats which is great for our support team. Overall, it's a great tool and I'd highly recommend it if you have a high number of calls or chats.",1

Pros:I use everyday Freshdesk solution. It's easy to use and has useful and powerful options to give support to my customers.,1
Great tool. Every company should use it.,1
Pros:Jira service desk helped my team enter customer satisfaction and bug issues .This was easy to use and a place to add comments,1
"FreshDesk is particularly good for SMEs with pretty standard help desk requirements. It can also handle much more complex use cases, but that generally needs additional help either from internal IT or outsourced.",1
Nel complesso mi è piaciuta molto e la consiglierei a qualsiasi a altra azienda,1
Pros:Zoho Desk is very well suited for supporting our customers which are coming from multiple countries accross Europe. This is a real good companion,1
"It has been a good experience overall.It has its pros and cons, it's fast, easy, full of fabulous and really useful features. However, if you're a non-technical person and try to this DIY the customization is really tough if by any chance you're unlucky to get a not so great account manager there.",1
We maintain a register of requests and quickly build monthly reports,1
"As a growing start-up and now a small business, we cut our teeth on Freshdesk. It did a great job early on as it just worked and was easy to use. However as we grew we found that it had a productivity crippling flaw, one they have known about for years, and that is SPAM.Once you get a batch of 2000+ blatant spam emails from Russia that create tickets, you quickly realize how bad it can get. We have received spam on almost a daily basis for a long time, but it was usually ranging from a couple to around 5 or 6 a day. You go in and mark the ticket as spam and block the email and are good to go. However as we got larger, we started getting them in batches of 100s and then even on that was 2000+. What made this bad is that the domain and IP were both blacklisted and the content failed standard spam tools with a very high score. So this would have been easy to block.So what makes this so painful, is that you now have to go manually close and mark as spam those 2000+ tickets , delete 2000+ emails from your inboxes, and try and keep up with your legit ticket queue.What made this worse, is when I went to their support forum and realize this has been a problem for years that they have known about and have showed no interest in fixing beyond the manual process.Unfortunately this made the difficult decision of changing support systems too easy, I won't say who we are switching to as I don't want it to seem I am trying to promote.",0
It is a very suited product for small user organisation who have just started interacting with internal or external customers.,1
Pros:Zendesk business rules such as triggers and automations are robust and work so well. Macros and views make day to day support a breeze.,1
"Overall, Zoho Desk provides an easy ticket management system along with a range of subscription plans from free to different prices with discounts.",1
I get to assign logs to consultants,1
My overall experience with JIRA has been great! It has really changed the way I work and I definitely feel more efficient when working with JIRA.,1

"Having been in the IT support industry for more than 20 years I've used a lot of different helpdesk systems and this has been, by far, one of the easiest to setup and run, and also one of the fastest.It lacks all the extra bells and whistles that something like Spiceworks has but if you already have other tools for network management etc... I've yet to find a better system for so little cost.",1
"Pros:Has all the features you'd need to provide support for your customers, integrates easily with my app, and is very reasonably priced.",1
Pros:The customization of the software is awesome. The software has good reporting and very easy to navigate. It is also user- friendly.,0
"Overall amazing experience, once you set it up and is customized to your use case it is going to perform greatly",1
"We've been using Zendesk Chat since it was Zopim. And while it's not the cheapest customer service chat out there, we've stuck with it, since it provides great integration to Zendesk, allows for shortcuts, integration of chatbots, and many more features.",1
"Overall, the free version is amazing.It has limited amount of agents but for a small IT department it is perfect.We use it for a ticketing system just to stay on top of the many projects/requests from the employees.It also keeps a record of work loads and task completed to show officials of the effectiveness of the department.",1

We used Zendesk to receive (technical) support questions by clients and to follow up on these with multiple colleagues.,1
"Pros:Freshdesk is very much appropriate for an organisation which has a huge Client Base. The Dashboard of Freshdeskgives a overall picture to the agents who are resolving the tickets on How many are Pending and how many are resolved. This has a creative and User friendly Interface Customers can raise the tickets in an easy manner and also customers would be able to track their ticket status and also comment on them. It is a beneficial tool for both customer and business in sorting out an Issue. The agents would also feel convenient in keeping track in the tickets. The Tickets goes exactly to the relevant Clusters. Freshdesk provides the feature of adding a comment before closing the ticket, this gives the notification to all the other team members that the ticket is closed. It also gives an overall graphical representation of the tickets which would give a trend on theTickets Received, so the agents would get an idea and cater to the tickets accordingly.",1

Hope to see more and more features getting added in the future so that it can maintain its position as a one-stop solution for every possible need of a firm w.r.t. customer service.,1

"In general, my experience with the freshdesk ticket machine was very good. We use it daily in the company and it is the backbone of our IT support system. I recommend it for its ease of use, its performance and its fair price.",1
Pros:The sheer number of features and application that could be used together with Zoho is amazing. Without Zoho we needed to use a patchwork of mostly average SaaS products which were almost impossible to properly integrate with each other. Zoho solved that problem admirably,1
"My company was having issues with tracking and measuring certain activities, and Zendesk solved a large part of this. Multiple teams have anccess to the tool, which helps to update everyone without having to actually get in contact or wait for an e-mail.",1

"Muy buena, siempre que puedo lo recomiendo.",1
"Pros:I used the software to manager mostly customer service emails- the amount of functions available to the user was great. Lead tracking, company website integration, and ticket sorting were helpful",1
Very helpful in keeping track of our inquiries and questions from our customers.,1
a good tool with good capabilities but you should take in mind the pricing package and users license that make this tool a very expensive one for big companies,1
FreshDesk has helped us keep our team and our clients all on the same page.,1
Pros:Amazing software easy to use and very fast server,1
My daily interaction with Freshdesk is mostly painless.I would recommended it to any small business.I wish I had been here when the initial set up was done so that I could take advantage of more options.I am now looking into those options for future use.,1
"Has the potential to be really good, but for our day to day operations, honestly, it probably caused more headaches than solved!",0
It helps to manage my daily work using tickets.,1
"We have based our entire support process on Zendesk and have gotten excellent results.

"Pros:It follows ITIL standards, It is free to use and support maintenance is inexpensive. It does support multiply languages.",1

We were nervous about support when it was clear we were getting transferred to an overseas center when we called, but we were pleasantly surprised that each support call was handled quickly, professionally, and in a helpful manner without long hold times. These guys are the exception to the rule in that regard.Conclusion: Good product at fair price from a good company.",1
Pros:1) Highly customisable. 2) Option of adding light agents for free3) Easy integration with social media accounts (Facebook and twitter)4) Option of adding email and ticket templates for easy and quick ticket creation.5) Blueprints is a great option for defining a process.6) Ease with which the knowledge base can be created and shared with the customer,1
"One thing I found weird with Zoho is Multiple excesses to Client portal. For example, if I want to use Zoho books and desk. I would need to provide multiple login access to my clients. Which would be confusing for the clients. I did not found the customer su[port very helpful. They push you from one line to another. There is really no one I found who can help me understand how the whole thing works and make the process smooth.",1
"Great experience, great product! Highly recommended to companies with customer support.",1
Enables me to be effective in my business and ensures satisfied clients. Provides me with full control and visibility of ticketing status.,1
"Pros:Easy to automate and has various features to prioritize tickets, handle priority tasks and support incidents. The biggest advantage is the ability to integrate with different systems such as Agiloft, JIRA, SecurityScorecard, CRM, etc. ServiceNow helps the implementing team to focus more on collaboration and process development rather than coding since it absolutely limits coding. It is also a well known enterprise GRC tool and has released a Vendor Module, which can be used in Source-to-Pay projects.",1
Pros:1. Easy to use interface and is very attractive too.2. One can customize in accordance to their need3. Helpdesk tool plays an important role in it as it allow to do marketing .,1
"For a very basic CRM it's fine, but get to an organization with any real scale, and I think Salesforce Service Cloud is a much more compelling option.There seems to be little to no capability in Zendesk to really build custom applications + flows to support business processes.So you end up trying to fit a round peg in a square hole.",0
Simple setup and highly customizable modules allowing for the very granular creation of feature sets.,1
Pros:The ticketing system and article database has been the most helpful in managing our tech support needs.,1
Great so far. I wish their most basic plan had more features because it can get expensive if you want more features. But even with the basic plan there is lots you can do.,1
My overall experience has been excellent! I’d definitely choose this software over any other similar.,1

"Whenever I had problems due to server down, Freshdesk gave support ASAP.",1
"Pros:user friendly, allows us to make all necessary changes, fields, modules, and many other things which are best.",1
"Pros:It's easy to use. It has many different functions, everything you need and more. But still you do not get lost in it's possibilities.",1
"Our business needs quickly expanded into handling over 50 tickets / work orders a day across multiple client sites. We were struggling to find a suitable solution that would cater for multi site, multi users without incurring addition costs for client access to their tickets. Freshdesk software ticked all the boxes when it came to the online portal access for clients and exporting ticket information into CSV files.",1
"Pros:As an existing Atlassian customer we were in the market for a new tool to manage our incidents, problems, requests, and changes. Jira Service Desk was simple to configure and deploy to our IT Service Desk.",1
